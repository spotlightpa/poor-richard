content = "Kamala Kelkar is a deputy editor at Spotlight PA. She’s a dogged muckraker, who has exposed injustices for more than a decade for many of the industry’s most trusted outlets. She most recently spent three years in Manhattan at PBS NewsHour; two on digital investigations and one leading its digital team for the weekend show. While there, the judicial reform nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice named her an influencer to watch for her reporting on prison labor and wrongful infractions. She was also invited by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, because of her Electoral College coverage, to speak on his first voting rights panel through his initiative at Columbia University. Her reporting abroad helped relocate a Hmong refugee family abandoned in Thailand and was cited by federal judges in India. She comes to the editor role vested in the power and necessity of local journalism and with intent to shake up traditional newsroom structures."
