content = "Liz Navratil has covered state government and politics for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Philadelphia Inquirer since 2017. She is part of the team that won a 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for coverage of the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Prior to arriving in the state capital, she covered crime for the Post-Gazette. During that time, she exposed the department's flawed response to a disconnected 911 call made by a woman who was murdered. She also worked as part of a team that revealed that the then-police chief and others worked together to steal from the bureau. She was named a finalist for an IRE Award and received a letter of commendation from the judges of the Al Nakkula Award for Police Reporting.\n"
