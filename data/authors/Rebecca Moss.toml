content = "Rebecca Moss joins Spotlight PA from The Santa Fe New Mexican, where she covered the environment, nuclear waste, problems at assisted living facilities, and clergy abuse within the Catholic Church. As part of ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network, she spent more than a year investigating serious worker health and safety problems at the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons facilities, as well as failures by the Department of Labor to fairly adjudicate workers' compensation claims. The reporting led to Congressional efforts to preserve an independent nuclear safety board. The series also won the Association of Health Care Journalists’ Award for Excellence in Health Care Journalism in the public health category and, in collaboration with Investigate TV, the National Headliner Award for environmental reporting. Prior to the New Mexican, she reported from Cambodia, where she covered public health and the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. Her work has also appeared in The Village Voice, Elle.com, and Vogue.com. Originally from New Mexico, she has a master's degree from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism."
