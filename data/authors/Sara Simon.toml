content = "Sara Simon joined Spotlight PA after nearly five years working behind the scenes in newsroom technology. As a software engineer at the New York Times, Sara built tools to help journalists manage documents and monitor websites, and she created databases to inform reporting on a range of topics. Prior to the Times, Sara was a web developer at Vermont Public Radio, where she built custom webpages for newsroom projects and worked across the NPR network to help smaller public radio stations improve their websites. Her introduction to reporting was there in Vermont, when an automated bot she built to alert Vermonters to sewage spills helped to prompt legislation requiring faster notice from state officials. Sara graduated from Wellesley College with honors in English and studied software development at the Turing School."
