His practice concentrated in counseling a diverse range of clients: high net worth individuals and business owners in need of tax effective estate planning and administration; families in creating and administering guardianships and special needs trusts; and individuals and organizations in structuring and administering nonprofit corporations. Bill also regularly handled cases in the Orphans’ Court Division across many of the counties in Eastern Pennsylvania, and was a court-appointed special counsel in Dauphin County.

Bill brings extensive experience in charitable matters. He has advised individuals on many aspects of charitable planning and the formation of private foundations and public charities.

Bill also has extensive service on nonprofit boards, having been the past Chair of the boards of the Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, the Berks County Community Foundation, the American Red Cross (Berks County Chapter), and is the current Chair of the Arthur Judson Foundation. His board service includes: Camphill Soltane; Mommy’s Light Lives on Fund; Helping Harvest; Opportunity House; the Oak Hill Lane Association and the Reading Symphony Orchestra. Bill brings special experience in the Governance function of boards. He has also served on the Vestry of Christ Church (Episcopal) and the Session of First Presbyterian Church, both in Reading.

Bill graduated from Williams College in 1976 and Duke Law School in 1979. He began his practice in Philadelphia at Ballard Spahr, but in 1988 he left Philadelphia to move his family and law practice to Berks County, first at Stevens & Lee and then Kozloff Stoudt. Bill and his wife, Jody, raised two children in Wyomissing and now reside as empty nesters in Spring Township. In addition to his ongoing board work, Bill enjoys golf and has reconnected with traveling, family genealogy and photography.
