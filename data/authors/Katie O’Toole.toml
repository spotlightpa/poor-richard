As voters, we’re less informed about the candidates who want to govern our towns and villages. As consumers, we’re often not aware of the decisions made by corporations and lawmakers that affect our wallets. As community members, we hear fewer stories about the triumphs and struggles of our neighbors—the kinds of stories that once challenged us to do better as a society or that gave us reason for communal celebrations. Spotlight PA’s State College Bureau is filling the gap left by the demise of small-town newspapers. Its journalists tell local stories and report on the meetings, events, issues, and institutions that form the foundation of our shared civic life.”*"
