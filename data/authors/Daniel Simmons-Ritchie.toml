content = "Daniel Simmons-Ritchie has worked in journalism for nearly a decade, most recently as an investigative reporter for PennLive/The Patriot News in Harrisburg, Pa. His journalism combines traditional reporting skills, including an extensive understanding of Pennsylvania’s Right-To-Know law, with data analysis and web scraping. His reporting has led to resignations, fomented lawsuits, sparked government reforms and earned more than a dozen state and national awards for public service journalism, including a 2017 Investigative Reporters & Editors award and a 2014 Sigma Delta Chi award from the Society of Professional Journalists. Simmons-Ritchie is formerly from New Zealand and moved to the U.S. in 2011.  Before he was hired by the Patriot-News in 2014, he worked as an enterprise reporter in South Dakota and as a county government reporter in southern Oregon."
