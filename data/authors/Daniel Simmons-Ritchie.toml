His journalism combines traditional reporting skills, including an extensive understanding of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Right-To-Know law, with data analysis and web scraping. His reporting has led to resignations, fomented lawsuits, sparked government reforms and earned more than a dozen state and national awards for public service journalism, including a 2017 Investigative Reporters & Editors award and a 2014 Sigma Delta Chi award from the Society of Professional Journalists. Simmons-Ritchie is formerly from New Zealand and moved to the U.S. in 2011.
