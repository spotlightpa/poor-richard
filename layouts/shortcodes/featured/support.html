        We believe everyone in Pennsylvania should have access to this kind of unique, in-depth, and essential public-service journalism regardless of what they can afford. That’s why we don’t have a paywall on our site, charge a subscription fee, or clutter our articles with ads that have nothing to do with our state. <b>Instead, we use the honor system.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 leading-snug">
        We are doubling down on the idea that if we ask our readers to contribute what you think we’re worth, we can build a sustainable business model for independent news. If you learned something from this report, if you were surprised, outraged, or simply feel more informed, will you <b>pay it forward and make a contribution to Spotlight PA now?</b>
