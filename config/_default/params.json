  "support-text": "I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, please consider supporting Spotlight PA's nonprofit journalism amid a high-stakes year for Pennsylvania and our democracy.\n\nOur 2024 coverage will be unlike anything you’ll find anywhere else. We’ll cover all angles of the upcoming election, focused squarely on the stakes for voters, not the horse race. We’ll continue to hold the Shapiro administration and our state legislature accountable. And we’ll deliver insightful investigative and explanatory journalism about urgent statewide issues and policies. \n\nAcross this country, a small number of billionaire owners and mega-corporations have a grip on our community media outlets — or worse, they're stripping them for parts and profit. Spotlight PA is different. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest and to serve you — not profit motives.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe do this work for you, but we cannot do it without you.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nNearly 1/3 of our total budget comes from individuals like you. Your support enables us to produce unique investigative and public-service reporting that demands accountability, inspires changes, and strengthens democracy. It's quick and any amount helps. Thank you for doing your part.\n\nWith gratitude,\nChristopher Baxter\nEditor in Chief, Spotlight PA\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePS: If you prefer to mail a check, you can send it to:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nSpotlight PA,\nPO Box 11728,\nHarrisburg, PA 17108-1728",
