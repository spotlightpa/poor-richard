Just the determination and passion to deliver high-impact investigative and public-service reporting for Pennsylvania, always free from commercial or political influence. \n\nWe provide our journalism for free to all Pennsylvanians because we believe in information equality. Greater numbers of people can keep track of the issues and events shaping our state, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action. Millions can benefit from open access to quality, truthful news, regardless of their ability to pay for it.\n\nEvery contribution, however big or small, powers our journalism in tight economic times and sustains our future.
