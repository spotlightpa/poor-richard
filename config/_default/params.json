  "support-text": "I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I wanted to ask if you would consider supporting Spotlight PA's nonprofit journalism in what will be a pivotal year for Pennsylvania.\n\nOur 2024 coverage will be unlike anything you’ll find anywhere else. We’ll cover all angles of the upcoming election, focused squarely on the stakes for voters, not the horse race. We’ll continue to hold the Shapiro administration and our state legislature accountable. And we’ll deliver insightful investigative and explanatory journalism about urgent statewide issues and policies. \n\nAcross this country, a small number of billionaire owners and mega corporations have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what’s happening. Spotlight PA is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider.\n\nOur journalism is produced to serve the public interest – not profit motives.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat's why we need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nYour support enables us to continue to produce unique investigative and public-service reporting that demands accountability, inspires changes, and strengthens democracy. Quality reporting is a public good, not a commodity to be bought and sold. That’s why we share it at no cost with more than 100 newsroom partners in your community and communities across the state.\n\nOur readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence, and accessible to all – whether they can afford to pay for news, or not. Consider making a tax-deductible contribution now to enable this work to continue, or better yet, support us with a sustaining monthly gift.\n\nPlease make a gift now.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\u003cstrong\u003eChristopher Baxter\u003c/strong\u003e\nEditor, Spotlight PA\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePS: If you prefer to mail a check, you can send it to:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nSpotlight PA,\nPO Box 11728,\nHarrisburg, PA 17108-1728",
