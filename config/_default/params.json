It’s not even about journalism or the news. It’s about a free society, which necessarily depends on the free flow of information grounded in truth and reality. If we lose that, we lose everything — and we will be forced to reckon with our own inaction.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut there is still time to join together and chart a better course.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThere are still professional journalists and independent organizations like Spotlight PA willing to take on the tough task of fighting on the front lines for the truth without fear or favor. They don’t do it for fame or glory, but out of a sense of duty and service. And they cannot do it without you.\n\nRight now, your tax-deductible support will ensure our vital work can continue.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd for a limited time, every dollar you give will be matched — that's DOUBLE your gift — by the Lenfest Institute for Journalism.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n— Christopher Baxter, CEO/President\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePS: If you prefer to mail a check, you can send it to:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nSpotlight PA, PO Box 11728, Harrisburg, PA 17108-1728",
