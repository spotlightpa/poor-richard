As a nonprofit, Spotlight PA's unmatched investigative and public-service reporting cannot continue without your support. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd as a special bonus today, your gift will be DOUBLED by a generous donor as part of our Spring Member Drive.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nOur 2024 coverage is unlike anything you’ll find anywhere else. We’re covering all angles of the upcoming election, focused squarely on the stakes for voters, not the horse race. We’re holding the Shapiro administration and our state legislature accountable. And we’re delivering insightful investigative and explanatory journalism about urgent statewide issues and policies. \n\nAcross this country, a small number of billionaire owners and mega-corporations have a grip on our community media outlets — or worse, they're stripping them for parts and profit. Spotlight PA is different. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest and to serve you — not profit motives.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe do this work for you, but we cannot do it without you.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nNearly 1/3 of our total budget comes from individuals like you. Your support enables us to produce unique investigative and public-service reporting that demands accountability, inspires changes, and strengthens democracy. It's quick and any amount helps — and right now it will be matched dollar-for-dollar. Thank you for doing your part.\n\nWith gratitude,\nChristopher Baxter\nEditor in Chief, Spotlight PA\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePS: If you prefer to mail a check, you can send it to:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nSpotlight PA,\nPO Box 11728,\nHarrisburg, PA 17108-1728",
