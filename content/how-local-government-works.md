## Spotlight PA State College is working to make local government more accessible and understandable to all Pennsylvanians.

Pennsylvania has a patchwork system of local government that includes more than 2,500 cities, townships, and boroughs (and one town).

‚ÄúHow Local Government Works‚Äù is a series by Local Accountability Reporter Min Xian. This series focuses on issues and trends in Pennsylvania local governments and provides tools for you to hold your local officials accountable. 

Our goal is to help you understand how your municipal government functions, the powers it possesses, and what responsibility it has to residents. We also want to provide resources that empower you to obtain information, get involved, and spot when something‚Äôs going wrong.
