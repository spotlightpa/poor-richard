Spotlight PA’s team of investigative reporters will [cover the state government and urgent statewide issues like never before](/press-releases/2019/spotlight-pa-unrivaled-team-of-investigative-reporters-to-hold-the-powerful-to-account-in-pa.-capital/), digging in hard on everything from health to the State Police to environment and more.

The goal: to tell stories no one else is telling, to be a catalyst for discussion and engagement, and to drive change.

That’s why we want to introduce you to each member of the team and tell you a little bit about what they’re covering, and how to contact them. Some of the most impactful journalism begins with a tip from a concerned reader. Reach out to the reporters directly, or check out [more secure ways of contacting our newsroom](/tips/).
