<em>Editor’s note: This interview first appeared in Spotlight PA’s </em><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/palocal/"><em>PA Local newsletter</em></a><em> on Sept. 9, 2022.</em>

Pennsylvania’s fleeting pawpaw season has arrived, and for the next few weeks the commonwealth’s native tropical fruit — nicknamed the &#34;hillbilly mango&#34; — is ripe for the picking, assuming you can find one.

We talked to Ohio chef, culinary educator, and author Sara Bir about <a href="https://beltpublishing.com/products/the-pocket-pawpaw-cookbook"><em>The Pocket Pawpaw Cookbook</em></a>, which includes an introduction by forager <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackforager/?hl=en">Alexis Nikole Nelson</a> and recipes for everything from pawpaw cornbread to pawpaw ketchup.

Our conversation — touching on the do&#39;s and definite don&#39;ts of the fruit and why Bir says she’s yet to meet a bad person who likes them — has been edited for clarity and length.

<strong>Spotlight PA: Can you describe the taste of a pawpaw for anyone who hasn’t tried one?</strong>

Sara Bir: I like to say that it is most like a mango and a banana and yet something completely unfamiliar &lt;<em>laughs</em>&gt;. It has a lot of tropical flavors. It is in the custard apple family. It’s the most northerly member of that fruit family. Its relatives are all down in the tropics.

<strong>What about texture?</strong>

When pawpaws are ripe they are very soft. They&#39;re like baby food.

<strong>What’s your favorite pawpaw recipe? I thought your pawpaw lassi idea was genius.</strong>

That is my favorite. I use buttermilk instead of yogurt, but you could certainly use yogurt. And I garnish it with a little nutmeg or cumin on top, which is really the only authentic part of this lassi.

<strong>What can’t a pawpaw do?</strong>

They don’t do well when heated. It has a lot of volatile flavor compounds that are destroyed when you heat them, leaving a bit of a funky aftertaste.

<strong>Got it. So best served cold. What about dried pawpaw?</strong>

Oh, Colin, that&#39;s an excellent question. It does not work. When you dehydrate a pawpaw or cook it down enough, it will concentrate a naturally occurring compound that is the same thing that is found in ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting.

<strong>So pawpaw lassi for my friends and fruit leather for my enemies. On that note: You once said, “I have yet to meet a person who is drawn to pawpaws who is not a good person.” What did you mean by that?</strong>

Sure. I think anybody who even hears about pawpaws is somebody who has their feelers out for something that&#39;s outside of their daily existence. They’re people who are open-minded.

<strong>Does the pawpaw have a type?</strong>

When I go to the <a href="https://ohiopawpawfest.com/">Ohio Pawpaw Festival</a> you see people with all kinds of backgrounds — religious backgrounds, political beliefs, lifestyles — but the thing they have in common is this affinity for an atypical fruit. (<em>Editor’s note</em>: York County, Pennsylvania has a pawpaw festival <a href="https://hornfarmcenter.org/pawpawfest/">happening in September</a> too.)

<strong>Is the pawpaw countercultural? Or is that going too far?</strong>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going too far. It&#39;s both countercultural and very, very traditional. It&#39;s a seasonal thing that was passed down through generations by the people who settled in these areas. I&#39;d almost say it&#39;s an underground thing. This whole slow-burning pawpaw phenomenon has been from the ground up, and it had to be because you can’t get them in stores.

<strong>Will that change?</strong>

There is pawpaw ice cream, gelato, and beer. But the reason you don&#39;t see the fresh fruit in stores is because the fruits ripen at different times on the same tree. You can&#39;t just pick them and have them ripen off the tree. If you bring a hard pawpaw home, it&#39;s gonna stay hard.

It would take years and years of \[selective\] breeding, and while plant people have been working on it, nobody’s been throwing money behind it.

<strong>What’s the best way to find them fresh then?</strong>

I mean this sounds ridiculous, but once you are identified as a pawpaw-curious person, there is somebody who&#39;s eventually going to come up to you in person or on social media and be like, &#39;Oh, hey, there&#39;s a pawpaw tree growing on blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#39;

And that&#39;s what&#39;s so cool about the whole thing: This has happened not because some marketer thought it was a great idea. It&#39;s not because an influencer is really into pawpaws and making smoothies that make your hair and skin beautiful. It&#39;s just people talking to people about stuff they think is cool.
