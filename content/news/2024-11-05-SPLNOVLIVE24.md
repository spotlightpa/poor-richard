<h2 id="spl-heading-1">Mail ballot challenges withdrawn in Centre County</h2>

<em>1:56 p.m.</em>

State Sen. Cris Dush (R., Jefferson) told the Centre County Board of Elections during a packed hearing on Tuesday afternoon that he’d withdraw his challenges against overseas mail ballot applications.

According to the Centre Daily Times, 124 ballots were <a href="https://www.centredaily.com/news/politics-government/election/article295004949.html">challenged in the county on Monday</a>, but there were duplicates and only 77 identified unique voters.

Several of the overseas voters attended the hearing by Zoom, with some saying the effort was an attempt to disenfranchise their vote. Dush apologized for the inconvenience of bringing together county staff, attorneys, and the commissioners, who are administering Tuesday’s election. However, he said he wouldn’t apologize for making sure the “system is secure.”

Voters who live abroad are able to cast a ballot in federal contests, like the presidential race, the CDT reported.

Dush said Tuesday at the public hearing that a friend, who he declined to name, paid for the challenges. According to the CDT, each one required a deposit of $10.

He added that he intended to reimburse the friend with his campaign funds.

“Thank you citizens for your votes and thank you county for your efforts and thank you all for being here to support the democratic process,” State College Borough Mayor Ezra Nanes said at the hearing.

Centre County isn’t the only county in Pennsylvania that had challenges to mail ballots.

Votebeat reported Monday that <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/11/pennsylvania-election-2024-ballot-challenges-overseas-voters/">thousands of mail ballot applications</a> across the state had been challenged.

“Throughout the day on Friday, several bad-faith mass challenges were filed in a coordinated effort in counties across the Commonwealth to question the qualifications of thousands of registered Pennsylvania voters who applied to vote by mail ballot,” <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/11/pennsylvania-election-2024-ballot-challenges-overseas-voters/">said Amy Gulli</a>, spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State. “These challenges are based on theories that courts have repeatedly rejected.” <em>—Marley Parish and Sarah Rafacz, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">‘It’s like a sporting event’</h2>

<em>1:37 p.m.</em>

State Sen. Devlin Robinson (R., Allegheny) has spent his Election Day visiting polling places in his district.

Robinson is a candidate in one of a handful of competitive races in the state Senate, running against Democratic candidate Nicole Ruscitto. He was first elected to the seat in 2020, in a district that has flipped back and forth between parties multiple times since 2012.

According to the last campaign finance reports, candidates have spent about $5 million on the race since the primary.

For his part, Robinson said that voters have mostly spoken to him about the state of the economy, wanting lower gas and grocery prices — something that transcends party affiliation.

He added that his community “definitely likes our hometown people,” when choosing who to vote for.

Robinson says he’s already hit polling places in the North Hills and Bridgeville neighborhoods, and will be heading out to the next polling place outside of Sewickley soon.

“It’s like a sporting event,” Robinson said of his competitive race. “I can really only take care of myself … and kind of let the chips fall where they may.”<em> —Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-3">U.S. Senate candidates vote</h2>

<em>1:21 p.m.</em>

Both of Pennsylvania’s major-party candidates for U.S. Senate have cast their ballots.

Republican Dave McCormick did so in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, while Democratic incumbent Bob Casey <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BobCaseyJr/posts/pfbid02RwcbaSzTzbZfwhAxU499PFtpi7a6KQVjcg6vJSVbYw3F9ZFghuXAhyMRULuRtoQXl">voted</a> in Scranton.

The race, which polls indicate may be close, will help determine control of the U.S. Senate. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/09/pennsylvania-election-2024-us-senate-candidates-bob-casey-dave-mccormick-third-parties/">Learn more about the candidates.</a> <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-4">Immigration is a motivating factor for daughter of an immigrant</h2>

<em>12:51 p.m.</em>

The main polling place in Palmerton, a small Rust Belt borough nestled about 20 miles north of Allentown, is bustling before noon.

Lisa Snell Kern — the judge of elections for one of the two precincts jammed into a Czech fraternal organization’s meeting hall — said turnout is on track for 2020’s turnout, which is the highest she’s seen in her 20-plus years as a judge.

One of those voters was Marianne, a retired accountant in her 80s who declined to give her last name.

She told Spotlight PA that she voted in person “because it’s traditional” and that she never intends to vote by mail.

She added that she voted straight Republican, citing immigration and the economy.

On the former, she hasn’t seen her small borough impacted by the issue. Still, she wants to see a crackdown on illegal entries to the United States.

“My father was an immigrant” from Czechoslovakia, she said. “He did it the right way.”

As for abortion, which has motivated many other women to vote for Democrats, she said “I just don’t worry about it.”

“It’s an individual decision,” Marianne said.<em> —Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-5">‘It’s about time’ for a woman president</h2>

<em>12:13 p.m.</em>

Anika Bhawalkar, 19, is excited to cast her first ballot for Kamala Harris.

“It’s about time we had a woman president,” Bhawalkar told Spotlight PA. “In 2016, it felt out of my hands.”

Bhawalkar, a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University who is studying physics, was accompanied by her friends and fellow CMU students.

She described her top priorities as protecting womens’ rights and climate change.

A native of Boston, Bhawalkar described her hometown as an “echo chamber,” saying that most of the residents there were “strongly blue.”

In Pennsylvania, however, Bhawalkar felt that her vote had a tangible impact.

Quincy Mangi, 21, added that their concerns also extended to First Amendment issues. Former President Donald Trump, they said, has spoken out repeatedly about restricting free speech on campus and punishing political enemies, which concerns them.

The friends told Spotlight PA that they would be “overjoyed” to see Harris win the election, but are holding their breath. <em>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-6">New machines in use in Philadelphia</h2>

<em>11:55 a.m.</em>

In Philadelphia, election officials are using new machines to open mail ballot envelopes that they hope will <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-2024-philadelphia-allegheny-county-mail-ballot-count/">contribute to a speedier count</a>. As of Tuesday morning, 185,255 mail ballots had been returned in the city. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-7">Cambria County polls will stay open until 10 p.m. per court ruling</h2>

<em>11:20 a.m.</em>

Polls in Cambria County will remain open until 10 p.m. under a court ruling, WJAC reports. Voting machines there are experiencing software issues, though officials stressed that “all completed ballots will be accepted, secured, and counted by the Board of Elections.”

In a statement, the Pennsylvania Department of State said it was in contact with the county: “Voters are continuing to vote by paper ballot, in accordance with normal operations, while the county resolves the issue with in-precinct scanning. We are working with the County to resolve this technical matter and remain committed to ensuring a free, fair, safe, and secure election.”

A county commissioner told <a href="https://www.wjactv.com/news/local/confirmed-ballot-printing-issue-causes-voting-problems-in-cambria-county">WJAC</a> the issue was ballot printing, not the machines themselves. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-8">Attorney general candidates near the finish line</h2>

<em>10:55 a.m.</em>

Eugene DePasquale, the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general, cast his vote Tuesday morning at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Pittsburgh’s Hill District.

He told reporters the rest of his Election Day would include calls, texts, and coffee.

He said his primary goal today is to encourage people to vote. DePasquale said that he’s not expecting violence at polling places, nor does he believe that most candidates will refuse to accept the results of the election, save for former President Donald Trump.

“I believe we have a safe system, a secure system. Again, it&#39;s because of a lot of the good people behind us that make sure it&#39;s that way,” DePasquale said.

Should he win, DePasquale said he’s prepared to deal with any election lawsuits that are still pending after he’s sworn in. His No. 1 priority if elected would be to ensure that “whoever the voters want as president, that’s who gets ratified.”

Hundreds of miles away in York County, Republican AG candidate Dave Sunday voted with his family in Spring Garden Township. “I feel great … It’s Election Day. This is one of the greatest days in America,” he told <a href="https://x.com/DispatchDawn/status/1853798424048452048/video/1">reporters</a>, via the York Dispatch. If elected, he says he plans to “get to work.”

“I’m looking forward to going right to work and doing everything I can to help keep our communities safe.” <em>—Kate Huangpu and Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-9">‘Morality is at an all-time low’</h2>

<em>10:47 a.m.</em>

It&#39;s voters like Duane Summers that make this Cumberland County precinct one to watch.

The precinct in Lower Allen Township is a microcosm of Pennsylvania&#39;s closely divided election this year — one widely expected to decide the presidential election.

In 2020, the precinct went to Trump — but only by just under 200 votes.

Summers showed up today at the polling station inside Christian Life Assembly to make sure the precinct again favors the former president.

Summers, a registered Republican who voted for Trump in 2020, believes the country has been &#34;spiraling downhill, morally and ethically&#34; over the past four years. Harris&#39; track record, he believes, demonstrates she is &#34;a two-faced liar&#34; who has changed her position on issues as political winds have shifted.

&#34;Morality is at an all-time low,&#34; said Summers, adding: &#34;I believe his policies will correct that.&#34;

Though he is not a one-issue voter, he said illegal immigration is his biggest concern. He believes it is the driving force for many of the country&#39;s problems, including an economy that has hurt working and middle-class voters.

When someone tells him Trump is unstable, selfish, and dangerous, he said: &#34;I actually just put a prayer on them, and ask them to find the light, to find real common sense.&#34; <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-10">‘Tomorrow will determine where our country will be heading’</h2>

<em>10:45 a.m.</em>

Glenn Grayson Jr., 38, cast his ballot at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Pittsburgh’s Hill District with his daughter in his arms.

Grayson, who works at a real estate nonprofit, brought his son and daughter with him when he went to cast his ballot. He wanted them to see him exercising his rights and impress upon them the importance of participating in democracy.

“My grandparents couldn’t vote,” Grayson told Spotlight PA. “I wanted to expose them to it, no matter how they end up voting.”

Grayson says that he typically tries to vote based on the character of a candidate rather than their party affiliation. But this election cycle, he was most excited to hopefully help elect the first Black female president.

He added that this was the first time he felt like the presidential race would have a direct impact on his everyday life, pointing to issues like abortion access and education funding.

“Tomorrow will determine where our country will be heading,” Grayson said of the results of the election.

At the same polling location, Joyce Booker, 70, said she likes the atmosphere of voting in person.

Even though her husband voted by mail, she said that she preferred walking to the polling place and casting her ballot on Election Day.

Booker, a retired cast technician, said that the main issue that brought her out today was women’s health. The overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, she said, caused women to die.

She also said that she feared that Trump would act as a dictator if reelected.

Booker was more hopeful that Harris would try to create positive change, though she acknowledged Harris’ efforts may be blocked by Congress.

“We are all going to suffer,” said Booker of potential Trump’s reelection. <em>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-11">College Democrats, Republicans make their final cases</h2>

<em>10:15 a.m.</em>

Voters at Penn State’s University Park campus slowly filed into the HUB-Robeson Center, asking PSU Votes — a nonpartisan university-run organization — for help finding their polling place or where to return their mail ballot.

Meanwhile, students operating tables for the campus Democrats and Republicans promoted their respective political parties and candidates.

Ryan Klein, 21, serves as president of the Penn State College Republicans and voted in person for former President Donald Trump early Tuesday morning. This is the first presidential election Klein, who grew up in Reading, has voted in, and he said the economy motivated his decision to support Republicans — including Dave McCormick for U.S. Senate and U.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson — down the ballot.

“Prices are extremely high. Rent, gas, groceries — these things are essential to everyday American life,” Klein said. “They’re higher than they were under the Trump administration, and I think it’s a direct result of bad policy. I feel it’s really important to get the right people in the right offices.”

Nearby, 22-year-old Baybars Charkas, president of the Penn State College Democrats, was stationed at a table promoting their candidates and passing out merch.

Charkas was fourth in line to vote at his downtown polling place Tuesday morning. He planned to attend a campaign event for state Rep. Paul Takac tonight, but first, he had to finish an essay due this afternoon.

“You don’t stop being a student,” he said.

Mobilizing voters on Penn State’s University Park campus could be pivotal for both presidential campaigns, though students living on Penn State’s campus have consistently registered but not voted in recent election cycles.

Voters in Centre County’s Precinct 24 (located at Penn State’s HUB) had 36% turnout in the 2016 presidential election, 24% turnout in the 2020 presidential election, but just 15% turnout in the 2022 midterm elections, according to data from Centre County Elections. Registrations for this precinct more than doubled between 2016 and 2020.

As of Nov. 4, there were 21,629 registered voters between the ages of 18 and 24 in Centre County, according to data from the Pennsylvania Department of State. Of those, 9,635 were Democrats, and 6,628 were Republicans. <em>—Marley Parish and Wyatt Massey, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-12">Plan B voting in Luzerne County</h2>

<em>10:06 a.m.</em>

Anne Marie Stiliha drove up to her polling place in Jenkins Township, Luzerne County, and her heart sank.

The line to vote was already dozens deep just a half hour after the polls opened, and the 74-year-old retired teacher has nerve damage from diabetes which impacts her mobility and vision.

“I’ll never be able to stand in line,” she said from her car window.

Stiliha told Spotlight PA that she had applied for a mail ballot three weeks ago. However, it didn’t arrive until this morning.

According to data collected by the Department of State, Luzerne County had among the lowest mail ballot return rates heading into Election Day. As of 8 a.m. this morning, 79% had been returned, the second lowest rate in the commonwealth. The statewide average return rate was at 85%.

Doing the mental math in her head, Stiliha told Spotlight PA she didn’t think she’d have time to fill it out, get to 10 a.m. doctor’s appointment for her sight, and drive herself to return her just-arrived ballot.

Luckily for her, poll watchers noticed her. After a brief wait, she was whisked inside ahead of the line and was able to cast her ballot.

That vote, she said, was for Harris.

“She has a new type of personality that could change the mood of the whole nation,” Stiliha. <em>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-13">‘We need to save our country’</h2>

<em>9:50 a.m.</em>

Gregory Stoner, 68, showed up at his polling place at Christian Life Assembly in Lower Allen Township, Cumberland County, wearing a red fedora-style hat and one of his favorite T-shirts. It&#39;s emblazoned with the image of rock musician Alice Cooper against the backdrop of an American flag, and the quote: &#34;History is made by those who show up. Register and Vote.&#34;

Stoner, who grew up in nearby Mechanicsburg, said he has been a registered Democrat for most of his adult life, but switched his registration this year to Republican because he no longer wants to be associated with the Democratic party.

His vote today, he said, is unapologetically for former President Donald Trump, as it was in 2020.

&#34;We need to save our country from what&#39;s happened over the last four years,&#34; said Stoner.

He always considered himself a moderate Democrat, he said, but the party has become too focused on progressive issues he does not support. Transgender and LGBTQ rights, he said, top the list of those issues.

&#34;I don&#39;t care what you do after the age of 18, but trying to teach transgenderism in our school systems to 5-year-old children … Walmart selling transgender clothing for children. This is just outright wrong,&#34; he said.

&#34;I don&#39;t even want my name associated with the Democratic party,&#34; said Stoner, who works for the housekeeping department at the area mall.

He said he shows up to vote in person, even though he suffers from fibromyalgia, because he does not trust mail voting.

&#34;As long as I have two hands that still work, and two legs that work, I will always do it in person,&#34; said Stoner. <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-14">Concerns about costs, rights</h2>

<em>9:44 a.m.</em>

In Jenkins Township, Luzerne County, Shahrooz Pourmonir, 66, cast a vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. After Donald Trump won, he said he hasn&#39;t cast a vote since.

“Once Hillary won the popular vote and he became president, I thought ‘this is bogus.’”

But eight years later, he stood in a long line outside a Luzerne County firehall ready to vote for Kamala Harris for president at the urging of his three daughters.

All three are in the Coast Guard, and all three were concerned Donald Trump and Republicans would take away their right to an abortion. So, despite his misgivings, the retired bus ticket agent went to the polls.

Thoughts of children and their future dominated many voters&#39; thoughts in this purple corner of Pennsylvania. Luzerne County has historically backed Democrats, but has increasingly voted for Republicans; it was one of three counties Trump flipped from Barack Obama in 2016 and he still won it in 2020 despite losing the state.

Amy, a 47-year-old pharmacist who declined to give her last name, waited in line with her six-year-old daughter. She told Spotlight PA her biggest issues were the southern border and the economy, which is why she is voting for Trump.

She said she’s felt the impact of immigration in her community, although she didn’t specify how. As for prices, she’s said her household has paid more for nearly every consumer good in the past few years.

“I want some steps to help inflation and make things affordable for working people,” Amy said.

Turning to her daughter, she joked: “Your Cheetos got expensive.”

A registered Democrat, Amy added she planned to split her ticket, but she didn’t specify how.

Another mother, Amy Ditoto, a 38-year-old social worker, told Spotlight PA she was voting for Harris because of concerns for her four-year-old daughter.

A former Florida resident, she’s voted for Republicans before when they are good on immigration and education, naming as an example former Gov. and current U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.

But she’s voting a straight Democratic ticket in Pennsylvania, Ditoto said. She doesn’t want her daughter to “have less rights than I did.”

As for immigration, “I’m not personally affected by it anymore,” Ditoto said. <em>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-15">Voting machine issues reported in Cambria County</h2>

<em>9:05 a.m.</em>

In Cambria County, voters are experiencing issues scanning their ballots.

County Solicitor Ron Repak told <a href="https://wjactv.com/news/local/officials-acknowledge-cambria-co-voting-issues-file-for-voting-time-extension">WJAC</a>: “The Cambria County Board of Election learned early this morning that a software malfunction in the County’s Electronic Voting System has prevented voters from scanning their ballots. This should not discourage voters from voting at their voting precincts. The Board has filed a Court Order extending the time to vote within Cambria County.” <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-16">Outside money pours into state races</h2>

<em>8:45 a.m.</em>

State-level races have attracted at least $9 million in independent spending from national political groups, dark money nonprofits, and other well-heeled interests, according to Pennsylvania Department of State records accessed Monday afternoon.

That’s on track to break independent spending in 2020, which reached $9.4 million when the same offices — including Pennsylvania attorney general — were last on the ballot.

Unlike typical campaign giving — in which a political committee or individual donates money, goods, or services to a candidate — independent expenditures are not coordinated with the campaign the donor hopes to aid.

Anne Wakabayshi, a Lehigh Valley-based Democratic political consultant, says such spending is typically done to avoid campaign finance limits, which Pennsylvania does not place on individuals or political committees.

But independent spending has other perks. By not coordinating with a campaign, a political group can take money directly from a corporate or union treasury instead of having to use voluntary donations to a PAC.

Independent spending also makes it easy to hide the ultimate source of the spending, Wakabayshi said, as the spender’s name won’t appear on their favored candidate’s campaign finance report. And finally, it can give the independent spender more control over the message and delivery of the ads.

Still, “in a lot of situations, I don’t know why they do that,” Wakabayshi said.

The single biggest independent spender is Keystone Prosperity PAC, which spent $2.7 million on TV ads and mailers supporting Republican attorney general candidate Dave Sunday.

According to Pennsylvania campaign finance records, Keystone Prosperity has a single funder — the Republican Attorneys General Association, a Washington, D.C.-based political group. The group had given Keystone Prosperity at least $4.8 million as of Oct. 21.

In turn, RAGA’s money has come from a slew of sources, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/464501717/">according to data collected by ProPublica</a>. That includes $3.5 million this year from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/us/politics/leonard-leo-marble-freedom-trust.html">the Concord Fund</a>, a conservative judicial advocacy group, as well as checks from a wide array of business interests, including big tech, fossil fuels, telecoms, and insurers.

Another big independent spender is the PA Chamber of Business and Industry, which has spent $1.6 million on digital ads, TV commercials, and mailers supporting Republican candidates or attacking Democratic candidates. A spokesperson for the chamber did not address questions about how the group spends political dollars, only saying that it supports “candidates who are committed to making Pennsylvania more competitive for businesses to grow, invest, and create jobs.”

Otherwise, independent spending mostly aided Democratic candidates, including from labor unions and environmental groups. The biggest boost came from the Pennsylvania Fund for Change, which spent at least $1.1 million on mailers, TV ads, and phone calls attacking Republicans or backing Democrats.

The group has been active in Pennsylvania legislative elections since at least 2018, and has received much of its past financial resources from <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-election-results-abortion-supreme-court-spending/">PA Alliance Action</a>, a 501(c)4 nonprofit that does not have to report its donors and has funded other Democratic-aligned dark money political spending.

At least 15 different groups reported $1.2 million on canvassing, door knocking, grassroots organizing, and other similar face-to-face voter engagement. Of that, all but $2,400 of the reported canvassing expenses was in favor of Democratic candidates.

Finally, one third party also had a sizable boost from independent expenditures. Forward Party attorney general candidate Eric Settle received $160,000 in supportive text messages paid for by a newly registered group, PA Fulcrum PAC. <em>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-18">Nearly 2M mail ballots returned as of election morning</h2>

<em>8:28 a.m.</em>

Pennsylvania approved nearly 2.2 million applications for mail ballots. As of Tuesday morning, voters had returned 1.9 million — more than 80%. Of those, 55% were returned by Democrats, 33% by Republicans, and 12% by other voters. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em><strong><em></em></strong>

<h2 id="spl-heading-19">A closely divided community</h2>

<em>8:20 a.m.</em>

Everett Hamilton was up early this morning, and his first task was to show up at the polling station at Faith Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Lower Paxton Township in Dauphin County.

Two precincts vote at this location, and they are both closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. In 2020, for instance, one of the precincts split 473 to 414 in favor of Joe Biden, according to Dauphin County&#39;s official returns. The other precinct went 905 to 898 — or just 7 votes — in favor of Biden.

The chair of the GOP committee in the township, Hamilton said most of his work ahead of the election was centered around engaging voters on the hotly contested race in the 10th Congressional District between Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry and Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson.

This morning, he said, he was there largely to watch the process. He is allowed to talk to voters, as long as he keeps a certain distance from the entrance — but he said he was &#34;keeping my mouth shut.&#34;

No one, he said, wants a paper handout urging them to vote one way or another.

&#34;Normally what happens is, we pass the stuff out, it goes in the trash can,&#34; he said. &#34;Some of them are nice enough to bring it back and say, ‘Here, reuse it.’”

&#34;But for the most part, people have made up their minds,&#34; said Hamilton. &#34;I&#39;ve said, anyone who doesn&#39;t know who they are going to vote for in this election is asleep.&#34; <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-20">A college student’s first presidential election</h2>

<em>8:15 a.m.</em>

A steady stream of voters trickled into the State College Municipal Building early this morning.

For Olivia Feliciano, a 21-year-old Penn State student, today’s election marked her first time voting for president. Joined by friends at a downtown polling place, she cast her ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris.

“I just think it’s really important to exercise your right to vote. I also am standing with the right to choose, reproductive rights,” she said. “I just feel very passionately about it, so I want to make my voice heard.”

Feliciano said she decided to vote in person because she felt “uneasy” about the mail-in system, citing concerns over <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168404/oregon-washington-arizona-ballots-drop-boxes-fires">ballots being set on fire</a> in three states leading up to the election.

“I just wanted to make sure for my own ease, just to do it in person,” she said. <em>—Marley Parish, Spotlight PA State College</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-21">Afraid for the future</h2>

<em>7:58 a.m.</em>

Hadley Ross, 15, is too young to vote. Still, she felt it was important to come to the polls this morning with her father, Rob Ross, to watch him cast his vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

She said politics have always interested her, and has tagged along with her dad on Election Day since she was a young child.

But this year, she said, feels different. More urgent.

&#34;I am just scared that if Trump wins, that rights might get taken away, especially abortion rights,&#34; said Hadley, who lives in Lower Paxton Township. &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just really scared and anxious.&#34;

Her father Rob, a registered Democrat, said he came today to vote &#34;his conscience.&#34;

&#34;You could say it&#39;s a vote against Donald Trump, but the truth of the matter is, Kamala is a good person, has good ideas, and will take the country in a good direction,&#34; he said.

Abortion rights — preserving them for the next generation — was a top issue for him, as was &#34;our standing in the world.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t feel that the image that Donald Trump puts out is,&#34; he said, his voice trailing off as he searched for the right word.

His daughter finished his thought before he could: &#34;American.&#34; <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-22">Processing 1000s of mail ballots in Allegheny County</h2>

<em>7:47 a.m.</em>

At 7 a.m., thousands of election workers at a Pittsburgh warehouse began precanvassing the more than 215,000 mail ballots returned in Allegheny County.

Sitting around long tables, the workers began opening envelopes, taking out ballots, and preparing them to be scanned through vote-counting machines.

Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states with widespread mail voting that doesn’t allow its election workers to begin processing those ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day. The state’s precanvassing policy can contribute to a long wait for unofficial results, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-2024-philadelphia-allegheny-county-mail-ballot-count/">though Allegheny County officials previously said they expect to finish counting tonight</a>.

As poll workers began their tasks, a group of partisan volunteers sat in an enclosed pen only a few yards away. These observers were picked by a political party or a candidate and approved by the county election’s office to watch the process. They are not allowed to interact with poll workers. <em>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-24">‘Affordability. Housing. Gas. Food.’</h2>

<em>7:26 a.m.</em>

For Brian Allen, 57, who lives in Lower Paxton Township, today’s election was his second time voting for president.

The first was in 2020, and today, he cast his vote for the same candidate as he did then: former President Donald Trump.

His vote, he said, was motivated by this: “A better America for my kids. Affordability. Housing. Gas. Food.”

“He \[Trump\] did it the first four years for us. We were in a better place,” said Allen.

Allen said he showed up in person to vote because he has no faith in voting by mail. He believes all voters, aside from those living or serving overseas or facing a disability, should be required to come to their polling station — with ID.

“There is better accountability,” he said. <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-25">‘Faith in humanity’</h2>

<em>7:12 a.m.</em>

By 6:47 a.m., the line outside Faith Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Lower Paxton Township in Dauphin County was more than 30 people deep.

By the time polls opened at 7 a.m., it had doubled in size, even as more cars rolled slowly into the already packed parking lot.

An election clerk, who only wanted to be identified by her first name — Rebecca — said turnout so early in the day this year has far surpassed what she experienced in the 2020 presidential election.

“It’s more and earlier,” she said. “It doesn’t surprise me … People are interested in the direction of the country.”

She wasn’t anticipating problems, even as the line continued to grow.

“I have a lot of faith in humanity,” she said. <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-26">The polls are open</h2>

<em>7 a.m.</em>

Polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m. As long as you are in line to vote by 8 p.m., you are entitled to cast a ballot.

<h2 id="spl-heading-27">‘What do I need to bring with me to vote?’</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

If this is your first time voting or your first time voting since changing addresses, you’ll need to bring proof of identification. This can include any government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or U.S. passport, a utility bill or bank statement that includes your name and address, or a military or student ID. <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">See the full list of options</a>. <em>— Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-29">What you need to know before heading to the polls</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

For those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-poll-watcher-election-2024-donald-trump-explainer/">Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/return-ballot.html">so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/provisional-ballot.html">provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/emergency-absentee-ballot.html">Read about those here</a>.

Like in 2020, be prepared to exercise patience this week and beyond. Election officials can only begin processing mail and absentee ballots this morning, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-mail-ballots-precanvassing-101/">which means it may take days to report the full unofficial results</a>.

Also, beware of mis- and disinformation about mail ballots, voting machines, and more. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em><strong></strong>
