<h2 id="spl-heading-1">A closely divided community</h2>

<em>8:20 a.m.</em>

Everett Hamilton was up early this morning, and his first task was to show up at the polling station at Faith Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Lower Paxton Township in Dauphin County.

Two precincts vote at this location, and they are both closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. In 2020, for instance, one of the precincts split 473 to 414 in favor of Joe Biden, according to Dauphin County&#39;s official returns. The other precinct went 905 to 898 — or just 7 votes — in favor of Biden.

The chair of the GOP committee in the township, Hamilton said most of his work ahead of the election was centered around engaging voters on the hotly contested race in the 10th Congressional District between Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry and Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson.

This morning, he said, he was there largely to watch the process. He is allowed to talk to voters, as long as he keeps a certain distance from the entrance — but he said he was &#34;keeping my mouth shut.&#34;

No one, he said, wants a paper handout urging them to vote one way or another.

&#34;Normally what happens is, we pass the stuff out, it goes in the trash can,&#34; he said. &#34;Some of them are nice enough to bring it back and say, ‘Here, reuse it.’”

&#34;But for the most part, people have made up their minds,&#34; said Hamilton. &#34;I&#39;ve said, anyone who doesn&#39;t know who they are going to vote for in this election is asleep.&#34; <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">A college student’s first presidential election</h2>

<em>8:15 a.m.</em>

A steady stream of voters trickled into the State College Municipal Building early this morning.

For Olivia Feliciano, a 21-year-old Penn State student, today’s election marked her first time voting for president. Joined by friends at a downtown polling place, she cast her ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris.

“I just think it’s really important to exercise your right to vote. I also am standing with the right to choose, reproductive rights,” she said. “I just feel very passionately about it, so I want to make my voice heard.”

Feliciano said she decided to vote in person because she felt “uneasy” about the mail-in system, citing concerns over <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168404/oregon-washington-arizona-ballots-drop-boxes-fires">ballots being set on fire</a> in three states leading up to the election.

“I just wanted to make sure for my own ease, just to do it in person,” she said. <em>—Marley Parish, Spotlight PA State College</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-3">Afraid for the future</h2>

<em>7:58 a.m.</em>

Hadley Ross, 15, is too young to vote. Still, she felt it was important to come to the polls this morning with her father, Rob Ross, to watch him cast his vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

She said politics have always interested her, and has tagged along with her dad on Election Day since she was a young child.

But this year, she said, feels different. More urgent.

&#34;I am just scared that if Trump wins, that rights might get taken away, especially abortion rights,&#34; said Hadley, who lives in Lower Paxton Township. &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just really scared and anxious.&#34;

Her father Rob, a registered Democrat, said he came today to vote &#34;his conscience.&#34;

&#34;You could say it&#39;s a vote against Donald Trump, but the truth of the matter is, Kamala is a good person, has good ideas, and will take the country in a good direction,&#34; he said.

Abortion rights — preserving them for the next generation — was a top issue for him, as was &#34;our standing in the world.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t feel that the image that Donald Trump puts out is,&#34; he said, his voice trailing off as he searched for the right word.

His daughter finished his thought before he could: &#34;American.&#34; <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-4">Processing 1000s of mail ballots in Allegheny County</h2>

<em>7:47 a.m.</em>

At 7 a.m., thousands of election workers at a Pittsburgh warehouse began precanvassing the more than 215,000 mail ballots returned in Allegheny County.

Sitting around long tables, the workers began opening envelopes, taking out ballots, and preparing them to be scanned through vote-counting machines.

Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states with widespread mail voting that doesn’t allow its election workers to begin processing those ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day. The state’s precanvassing policy can contribute to a long wait for unofficial results, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-2024-philadelphia-allegheny-county-mail-ballot-count/">though Allegheny County officials previously said they expect to finish counting tonight</a>.

As poll workers began their tasks, a group of partisan volunteers sat in an enclosed pen only a few yards away. These observers were picked by a political party or a candidate and approved by the county election’s office to watch the process. They are not allowed to interact with poll workers. <em>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-5">Know your rights</h2>

<em>7:30 a.m.</em>

Whether you cast your ballot in person or by mail on Nov. 5, you want to make sure your vote counts. The best way to do that is to know your rights.

<h2 id="spl-heading-6">‘Affordability. Housing. Gas. Food.’</h2>

<em>7:26 a.m.</em>

For Brian Allen, 57, who lives in Lower Paxton Township, today’s election was his second time voting for president.

The first was in 2020, and today, he cast his vote for the same candidate as he did then: former President Donald Trump.

His vote, he said, was motivated by this: “A better America for my kids. Affordability. Housing. Gas. Food.”

“He \[Trump\] did it the first four years for us. We were in a better place,” said Allen.

Allen said he showed up in person to vote because he has no faith in voting by mail. He believes all voters, aside from those living or serving overseas or facing a disability, should be required to come to their polling station — with ID.

“There is better accountability,” he said. <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-7">‘Faith in humanity’</h2>

<em>7:12 a.m.</em>

By 6:47 a.m., the line outside Faith Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Lower Paxton Township in Dauphin County was more than 30 people deep.

By the time polls opened at 7 a.m., it had doubled in size, even as more cars rolled slowly into the already packed parking lot.

An election clerk, who only wanted to be identified by her first name — Rebecca — said turnout so early in the day this year has far surpassed what she experienced in the 2020 presidential election.

“It’s more and earlier,” she said. “It doesn’t surprise me … People are interested in the direction of the country.”

She wasn’t anticipating problems, even as the line continued to grow.

“I have a lot of faith in humanity,” she said. <em>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-8">The polls are open</h2>

<em>7 a.m.</em>

Polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m. As long as you are in line to vote by 8 p.m., you are entitled to cast a ballot.

<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/11/pennsylvania-general-election-day-2024-voter-information/">Here’s more of what you need to know to vote today</a>. <em>— Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-9">‘What do I need to bring with me to vote?’</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

If this is your first time voting or your first time voting since changing addresses, you’ll need to bring proof of identification. This can include any government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or U.S. passport, a utility bill or bank statement that includes your name and address, or a military or student ID. <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">See the full list of options</a>. <em>— Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-10">How to report a problem while voting or get voting info</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

If you need last-minute voting information, you can seek official answers from the Pennsylvania Department of State by calling 1-877-VOTESPA. The nonpartisan <a href="https://866ourvote.org/">Election Protection coalition</a> has its own hotline, as well: 866-OUR-VOTE.

If you need to lodge a complaint about something you experience while voting, you can call the state’s hotline (1-877-VOTESPA) or reach the department using this <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/ReportElectionComplaints.aspx">form</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-11">What you need to know before heading to the polls</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

For those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-poll-watcher-election-2024-donald-trump-explainer/">Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/return-ballot.html">so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/provisional-ballot.html">provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/emergency-absentee-ballot.html">Read about those here</a>.

Like in 2020, be prepared to exercise patience this week and beyond. Election officials can only begin processing mail and absentee ballots this morning, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-mail-ballots-precanvassing-101/">which means it may take days to report the full unofficial results</a>.

Also, beware of mis- and disinformation about mail ballots, voting machines, and more. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em><strong></strong>
