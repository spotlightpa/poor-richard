<h2 id="spl-heading-1">The polls are open</h2>

<em>7 a.m.</em>

Polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m. As long as you are in line to vote by 8 p.m., you are entitled to cast a ballot.

<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/11/pennsylvania-general-election-day-2024-voter-information/">Here’s more of what you need to know to vote today</a>. <em>— Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">‘What do I need to bring with me to vote?’</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

If this is your first time voting or your first time voting since changing addresses, you’ll need to bring proof of identification. This can include any government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or U.S. passport, a utility bill or bank statement that includes your name and address, or a military or student ID. <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">See the full list of options</a>. <em>— Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-3">How to report a problem while voting or get voting info</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

If you need last-minute voting information, you can seek official answers from the Pennsylvania Department of State by calling 1-877-VOTESPA. The nonpartisan <a href="https://866ourvote.org/">Election Protection coalition</a> has its own hotline, as well: 866-OUR-VOTE.

If you need to lodge a complaint about something you experience while voting, you can call the state’s hotline (1-877-VOTESPA) or reach the department using this <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/ReportElectionComplaints.aspx">form</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-4">What you need to know before heading to the polls</h2>

<em>3 a.m.</em>

For those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-poll-watcher-election-2024-donald-trump-explainer/">Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/return-ballot.html">so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/provisional-ballot.html">provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot/emergency-absentee-ballot.html">Read about those here</a>.

Like in 2020, be prepared to exercise patience this week and beyond. Election officials can only begin processing mail and absentee ballots this morning, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-mail-ballots-precanvassing-101/">which means it may take days to report the full unofficial results</a>.

Also, beware of mis- and disinformation about mail ballots, voting machines, and more. <em>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</em><strong></strong>
