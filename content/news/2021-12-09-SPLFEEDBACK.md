<i>This article is part of a yearlong reporting project focused on redistricting and gerrymandering in Pennsylvania. It is made possible by the support of </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> members and </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/20201019151248/https://votebeat.org/"><i>Votebeat</i></a><i>, a project focused on election integrity and voting access.</i>

HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s first proposed congressional map has arrived.

The map was picked by House Republicans from among 19 citizen submissions and was <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-gop-proposal/">drawn by former Lehigh County Republican Commissioner Amanda Holt</a>, a well-known redistricting reform advocate.

The redistricting process will now kick into high gear, as lawmakers hold hearings and begin to take votes while considering additional public input.

It’s important to note the <a href="https://web.archive.org/20211204111311/http://www.paredistricting.com/">proposed House map</a> will likely undergo changes as it moves through the legislative process, and that two state senators plan to release their own map next week.

After passing the GOP-controlled House and Senate, a congressional map must also win the approval of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf to go into effect.

Here’s how to get involved:
