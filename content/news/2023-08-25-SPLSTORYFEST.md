Spotlight PA is thrilled to announce it is participating in <a href="https://www.storyfest.org/">Philly Story Fest</a>, a first-of-its-kind festival that brings together storytellers from across the city on one stage.

This event is an opportunity for the public to engage with the people who work tirelessly to bring them the news and to celebrate the rich cultural fabric that makes Philadelphia a beloved city.

In collaboration with Spotlight PA, Rupalee Rashatwar, staff attorney at the Abolitionist Law Center, will tell the story of how she and others fought to release 65-year-old Bradford Gamble from state prison. Spotlight PA’s Danielle Ohl reported on <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/04/pa-compassionate-prison-release-petitioner/">Gamble’s late-stage cancer diagnosis</a> and the state’s troubled “compassionate release” law. <strong></strong>

Spotlight PA will be joined by outlets including Billy Penn, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philly Mag, The Philadelphia Citizen, Root Quarterly, Resolve, WHYY, and WURD.

The festival takes place Thursday, Oct. 5 from 7-10 p.m. at the Bok building in South Philadelphia (1901 South 9th St.).
