State and federal laws protect your right to cast a ballot regardless of race, ethnicity, language, or disability. However, voting access in Pennsylvania isn’t always equal.

Voters here do not have equal opportunities to correct mail ballots if they make a technical mistake like forgetting to date the return envelope. At least 16 counties do not give voters a chance to “cure” their mail ballots, a <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/en/pennsylvania-counties-notice-and-cure-policies">recent analysis</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania found. Spotlight PA and Votebeat <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/02/pa-2022-election-drop-box-mail-ballot-curing-scorecard/">found similar disparities</a> last year.

And in recent years, civil rights organizations have revealed access issues affecting <a href="https://wearecasa.org/voting-rights-advocates-win-lawsuit-against-york-county-board-of-elections/">people who don’t speak English</a> or <a href="https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2024-09-09/civic-engagement-and-voting/access-for-all-making-voting-easier-for-pennsylvanians-with-disabilities/a92263-1#:~:text=Examples%20include%20inaccessible%20polling%20places%2C%20insufficient%20training%20for%20poll%20workers%20on%20accessible%20ballot%2Dmarking%20devices%2C%20and%20misconceptions%20about%20the%20capacity%20of%20disabled%20voters%2C%20and%20more.">who have a disability</a>.
