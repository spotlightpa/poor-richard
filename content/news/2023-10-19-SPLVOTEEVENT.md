On Nov. 7, voters across Pennsylvania will choose the next state Supreme Court justice and new judges to sit on Commonwealth and Superior Courts. They’ll also cast ballots in smaller municipal races for offices such as mayor and school board, and answer local ballot questions.

Ahead of Election Day, Spotlight PA and Pennsylvania Voice — an nonprofit working to expand voting participation and secure equitable representation in state government — are holding a live election FAQ panel.

On Thursday, Nov. 2 from 6-7 p.m. ET, join us on Zoom to discuss voting rights in Pennsylvania, important dates and deadlines, and other key election information.
