On Nov. 7, voters across Pennsylvania will choose the next state Supreme Court justice and new judges to sit on Commonwealth and Superior Courts. They’ll also cast ballots in smaller municipal races for offices such as mayor and school board, and answer local ballot questions.

Ahead of Election Day, Spotlight PA and Pennsylvania Voice — a nonprofit working to expand voting participation and secure equitable representation in state government — held a live election FAQ panel. Watch it below.

<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>

- <strong>Elizabeth Estrada,</strong> democracy editor, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Salewa Ogunmefun,</strong> executive director, Pennsylvania Voice

- <strong>Jeff Greenburg</strong>, senior advisor, Committee of Seventy
