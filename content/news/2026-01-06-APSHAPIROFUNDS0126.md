HARRISBURG — <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/topics/josh-shapiro/">Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro</a> set another campaign finance record for Pennsylvania with $30 million on hand as he seeks a second term this fall, his campaign said Tuesday.

Pennsylvania has emerged as the nation’s premier <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-democrats-trump-harris-bob-casey-election-fe194ab48323c645c5909e12b5fb3720">presidential battleground</a> state, and Shapiro’s strong showing in the 2022 governor’s race <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-successor-democrats-2028-presidential-hopefuls-e335f0b82972e683cdd346f0d9ea881b">elevated his profile</a> within the Democratic Party, where he’s viewed as a potential 2028 White House contender.

In the general election, Shapiro, 52, is expected to face Stacy Garrity, the twice-elected state treasurer who has been endorsed by the state Republican Party. Garrity had yet to report campaign fundraising details as of Tuesday. The deadline to file campaign finance reports with the state is Jan. 31.

Shapiro isn’t expected to face a serious challenge in the May 19 primary election. The deadline to submit paperwork to get on the primary election ballot is March 10.

Shapiro’s $30 million dwarfs the previous state record for a candidate heading into an election year. Shapiro set the previous record, reporting $13.4 million <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-pennsylvania-campaigns-labor-unions-ceac8379af4e3da3cb55500645bc1d4d">at the start of 2022</a>.
