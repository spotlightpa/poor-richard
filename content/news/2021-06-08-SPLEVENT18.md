Pennsylvania is gearing up for a big fight over congressional redistricting, amid census delays, the loss of a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, and a tense climate after the last map was overturned by the state Supreme Court.

On Friday, June 18 at 1 p.m., <a href="https://vimeo.com/564804537">Spotlight PA hosted a live conversation with Republican State Sen. David Argall of Schuylkill County</a>, who will play a powerful role in the process of redrawing Pennsylvania’s congressional map for the next decade.

A full recording of the event is available below.
