HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s 2025 municipal election is quickly approaching. If you still have questions about where your polling place is, who is on the ballot, and how to vote, Spotlight PA has you covered.

On Tuesday, Nov. 4, voters across the commonwealth will elect candidates to fill a wide range of municipal roles. Ballots will vary depending on where you live, and could include lines for mayor, school board, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/pennsylvania-general-election-2025-auditor-tax-collector-election/">local finance positions</a>, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/pennsylvania-general-election-2025-local-supervisors-council-members-election/">city council</a>, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/pennsylvania-election-worker-crisis-precincts-elections/">judge of elections</a>, various judicial offices, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/election-sheriff-pennsylvania-election/">sheriff</a>, district attorney, and more.

Statewide, voters will also weigh in on candidates for <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/pennsylvania-election-2025-commonwealth-superior-court-candidates-elections/">Commonwealth and Superior Courts</a>, and decide whether to retain three state <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/supreme-court-retention-election-2025-pennsylvania-donohue-dougherty-wecht-elections/">Supreme Court justices</a>.

Before you submit your ballot, here’s a last-minute checklist of everything you’ll need to vote.

First, the basics:

- Make sure you’re registered. You can check your voter registration status <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">on the Pennsylvania Department of State website</a>. Unfortunately, if you’re not already registered, it’s too late to vote in this election cycle.

- It also is too late to request a mail ballot if you haven’t already. If you have, you can track your mail ballot on the <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of State&#39;s election ballot status webpage</a>. To be counted, your ballot must be received by your county election office by 8 p.m. on Election Day. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/pennsylvania-municipal-election-2025-mail-ballot-how-to-request-fill-out-return-elections/">Read more about mail ballots and how to properly fill them out</a>.

- If you plan to vote in person, you can find your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">online</a>.

- You need to bring a form of ID such as a driver’s license or a passport if it’s your first time voting at your polling location. You can find the full list of acceptable IDs <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/vote/voter-support/new-voters.html">on Pennsylvania&#39;s official election website</a>.

- Still have questions? You can reach out to your county election office for answers. Find contact information for your local county on the <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Resources/Pages/Contact-Your-Election-Officials.aspx">Pennsylvania election website</a>.
