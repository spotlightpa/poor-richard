<i><b>Final update, May 18, 2022: </b></i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/05/pa-primary-2022-governor-election-results/"><i><b>Doug Mastriano has won the Republican nomination for governor. He will face Democrat Josh Shapiro in the fall.</b></i></a>

HARRISBURG — When Democrats head to the polls on May 17 for Pennsylvania’s 2022 primary election for governor, there will be just one choice on the ballot.

Republicans will face a much different situation, with nine candidates and still no clear frontrunner.

Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat first elected in 2014, is unable to run for re-election due to term limit restrictions. In this vacuum, Republicans have an opportunity to win the executive branch, which would leave them in control of the governor’s office as well as the legislature.

<script src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version="1" data-spl-src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/"></div>

Wolf has often served as a foil to the GOP-majority General Assembly during his tenure, vetoing efforts to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/06/pa-election-overhaul-voter-id-wolf-veto/">rewrite the state’s Election Code</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230117020624/https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-vetoes-resolution-that-would-hinder-pennsylvanias-ability-to-address-climate-crisis/">roll back environmental policies</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230116212424/https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-vows-to-veto-proposed-anti-abortion-legislation-asks-general-assembly-to-focus-on-solutions-to-support-children-and-families/">further restrict abortion access</a>. Many GOP candidates have vowed to sign such legislation.

Democrats have a voter registration edge over Republicans in the state, though that 500,000-plus <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2022/01/27/pa-voter-registration-more-democrats-than-republicans-switching-political-party/9212221002/">advantage has been shrinking</a>. While Wolf easily won reelection in 2018, close gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia last year have political watchers expecting a tight race here.

Here’s what you need to know about the 2022 primary governor election before going to the polls:

Elected attorney general in 2016, Shapiro has been involved in Pennsylvania politics since 2004 — first as a state representative, then as a county commissioner in Montgomery County. As Pennsylvania’s top prosecutor, Shapiro investigated sexual abuse perpetrated by members of the Catholic Church and pursued cases relating to the opioid epidemic.

Shapiro has listed defending voting access, maintaining abortion rights, and rebuilding infrastructure as major tenets of his campaign.

<b>Supports repealing Pa.’s no-excuse mail voting law? </b>No. Shapiro has said he would <a href="https://web.archive.org/20220418163955/https://joshshapiro.org/votingrights/">reject any effort</a> to repeal the law known as Act 77.

<b>Lou Barletta</b> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/20220401203907/https://www.loubarletta.com/">Website</a>

Barletta started his political career in Hazleton on the city council in 1998 and then as mayor in 2000. In 2010, Barletta was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for eight years. He unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2018. Without providing specifics, Barletta is running on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/20220403180429/https://www.loubarletta.com/issues">myriad of issues</a> including strengthening the economy, school choice, and oil and natural gas production; limiting access to abortion; and addressing “illegal immigration.”

<b>Supports repealing Pa.’s no-excuse mail voting law?</b> Yes. Barletta has called Act 77 “unconstitutional” and believes the state needs signature verification and stricter voter ID requirements. During Republican attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Barletta was included on a <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/pa-republicans-hedged-language-may-have-saved-them-from-prosecution-over-electoral-vote-scheme/article_849d4f7e-7589-11ec-8881-6383a823557d.html">list of alternate Republican electors for Trump</a>.

“The language of the Pennsylvania document clearly states that this was done in case it was later determined that different electors were needed,” a Barletta campaign spokesperson <a href="https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/barletta-campaign-responds-to-probe-of-fake-electors/article_6efb20ea-2676-5d3a-bab6-c1f4257b3db4.html">told</a> The Citizens’ Voice.

<b>Supports repealing Pa.’s no-excuse mail voting law?</b> Yes. Corman voted for Act 77, but following the 2020 election, he’s supported its repeal and called for stricter voter ID requirements and third-party audits.

Gale calls himself “staunchly pro-life,” and said one of his top priorities is ousting Republicans he considers insufficiently conservative.

Gerow, a prominent Republican political strategist, began his career working for Ronald Reagan. Since then, Gerow has worked as a lobbyist and consultant, opening his own public communications firm. He currently serves as the vice-chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).

Gerow has called himself a “Ronald Reagan Republican,” saying that he is best positioned to bridge the gap between the traditional Republican party and the increasingly radical wing of his party.

His election platform has focused on promoting economic growth through traditional conservative fiscal policies of reducing taxes and regulation and wants to promote the state’s energy industry.
