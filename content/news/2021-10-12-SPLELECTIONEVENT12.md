On Nov. 2, voters statewide will decide the future makeup of Pennsylvania’s appellate judicial system.

Judges who serve on the state’s Commonwealth, Superior, and Supreme Courts regularly weigh in on disputes about the day’s most consequential issues. In 2020 alone, justices on the high court issued several rulings regarding the presidential election and pandemic — in essence settling fierce policy battles between Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and the Republican-controlled legislature.

Some GOP lawmakers are pushing to change the way these judges are elected as the courts take on an increasingly important role in Pennsylvania politics.

On Thursday, Oct. 21, Spotlight PA held a free panel on who is on the ballot this November, what’s at stake, and why it matters. Watch it below.
