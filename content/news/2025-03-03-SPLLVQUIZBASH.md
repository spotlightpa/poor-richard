Our first-ever public fundraiser in the Lehigh Valley was a huge success!

The “Clink and Think” Quiz Bash on Sunday, May 4 at Fegley’s Brew Works saw almost 100 guests coming together to compete for prizes during a Pennsylvania-themed trivia contest.

Hosted by Tony Iannelli, Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce President/CEO, the evening was full of fun and raised over $7,500 for Spotlight PA!
