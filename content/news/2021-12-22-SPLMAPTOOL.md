<b>UPDATED: March 16, 2022</b>

After several delays, Pennsylvania has finalized its political districts for the May 2022 primary.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in February <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/02/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-supreme-court-pick/">selected a new congressional map</a> that closely resembles the current one, with the partisan makeup of the state’s delegation unlikely to change dramatically. The U.S. Supreme Court in March declined a request to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/politics/supreme-court-2022-election-pennsylvania-north-carolina/index.html">block the map's usage</a> for this year's primary election.

In a separate process, a redistricting panel in February <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/02/pennsylvania-redistricting-legislative-maps-final-vote/">approved final state House and Senate maps</a> that could fundamentally reshape the legislature. The boundaries survived <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/03/pennsylvania-legislative-maps-constitutional-supreme-court-challenges/">nine legal challenges</a> and will be used for the primary election.

<i>About the data: The Legislative Reapportionment Commission provided </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/20210327184823/https://www.redistricting.state.pa.us/maps/"><i>map files</i></a><i> for the state House and Senate. Unlike a decade ago, the panel drew new districts using data that reallocated incarcerated people with a sentence under 10 years to the district of their last known home address.</i>

<i>The previous congressional map file came from the LRC. The files for the new congressional map were submitted during a court case and <a href="https://web.archive.org/20220223161733/https://www.pacourts.us/2022-redistricting-opinions">made publicly available</a>.</i>

<i>The </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/20210113142952/https://redistrictingdatahub.org/"><i>Redistricting Data Hub</i></a><i> provided voter registration data as of August 2021, and Peter Horton cleaned and reformatted census data used to conduct this analysis. This analysis also used data from </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/20210102053945/https://davesredistricting.org/maps#home"><i>Dave’s Redistricting</i></a><i>.</i>
