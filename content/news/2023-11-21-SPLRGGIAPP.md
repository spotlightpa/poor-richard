HARRISBURG — Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office said Tuesday that it has appealed two Commonwealth Court decisions that struck down Pennsylvania’s participation in an interstate program to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change.

Shapiro has been unwilling to commit to keeping Pennsylvania in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and the administration made it clear that the appeal is not a pledge to do so.

It’s now up to the state Supreme Court to decide whether it will take up the appeal.

In a statement, Shapiro’s administration said the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/regional-greenhouse-gas-rggi-struck-down-pennsylvania-climate-change-fossil-energy/">Commonwealth Court decisions on RGGI</a> were “limited to questions of executive authority, and our Administration must appeal in order to protect that important authority for this Administration and all future governors.”

The statement went on to say that Shapiro is ready to implement the <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/rggi-working-group-concludes-its-work-co-chairs-hail-collaborative-process-that-brought-diverse-group-together-reached-consensus-on-a-number-of-key-issues%EF%BF%BC/">recommendations</a> of a working group that he convened earlier this year. The group found that cap-and-trade programs are the best way for Pennsylvania to reduce emissions <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/10/pennsylvania-climate-change-josh-shapiro-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative/">but didn’t endorse RGGI in particular</a>.

The statement ended by urging the divided legislature to take the issue seriously.

“Should legislative leaders choose to engage in constructive dialogue, the Governor is confident we can agree on a stronger alternative to RGGI,” the statement said. “If they take their ball and go home, they will be making a choice not to advance commonsense energy policy that protects jobs, the environment, and consumers in Pennsylvania.”
