Like many of you, we at Spotlight PA enjoy a good crossword puzzle. So we decided to make our own with help from the folks at Amuse Labs and cruciverbalist Russell Frank.

Months after a mini version sent to readers of our weekly <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/palocal/">PA Local newsletter</a> yielded responses such as “I enjoyed it and learned new facts about PA,” “stress free at a time when needed,” and “Loved it!!” we decided to create a longer and more challenging puzzle with a theme: Name That Pennsylvania Town.

While crosswords aren’t a regular Spotlight PA feature as of now, your feedback could change that. Here’s <a href="https://hsqxo6lncmz.typeform.com/to/wULCX8R2">a short questionnaire</a> to fill out after you’ve played.<br/>

For now, a few important pointers to get you started:

- There is a timer function. It can be hidden in the &#34;settings&#34; tab. (That&#39;s the sprocket symbol on mobile.)

- There are hints and other aids in the &#34;assist&#34; tab. (That&#39;s the light bulb symbol on mobile.)

- On the “check letter” or “check word” assist features, mistakes will be highlighted in red. Correct letters or words will show no change in appearance.

- If you&#39;d like to print a copy, simply hit &#34;print.&#34; (On mobile, you&#39;ll find it by clicking on the three horizontal lines in the upper-left corner of your screen.)

If you encounter any technical issues, email Lead Editor of News Products Colin Deppen (<a href="mailto:newsletters@spotlightpa.org">newsletters@spotlightpa.org</a>).

And good luck!
