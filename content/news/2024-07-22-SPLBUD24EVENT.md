HARRISBURG — Lawmakers have finalized Pennsylvania’s new $47.6 billion budget — and no one is completely happy.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro didn’t get recreational marijuana or a tax on skill games; legislative Democrats didn’t get a minimum wage increase; and legislative Republicans didn’t get tax cuts.

Still, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/pennsylvania-budget-public-schools-economic-development-scholarships-josh-shapiro-legislature/">plenty made it into the final plan</a>. It increases K-12 education spending, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/pennsylvania-legislature-budget-deal-education-spending-public-schools-josh-shapiro/">sends $500 million to the state’s poorest schools</a>, funnels new dollars into economic development, and creates a new college scholarship program.

For more insight on the spending plan, Spotlight PA’s Capitol reporter Stephen Caruso is hosting a live panel.

Join him on Thursday, July 25 from 6-7 p.m. on Zoom for a discussion on the major components of the budget, the politics that shaped the deal, and what was left on the cutting room floor.

<strong>Our panelists include:</strong>

- <strong>Stephen Caruso,</strong> Capitol reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Kristina Moon</strong>, senior attorney, Education Law Center

- <strong>Mustafa Rashed,</strong> president &amp; CEO, Bellevue Strategies
