All 13 million Pennsylvanians have depended on caregivers. We all start life as infants, after all. But caregivers are vital long after childhood, including during periods of crisis and sickness. Some of us have disabilities. And for those who are lucky enough to live long lives, we need help as we age.

Many Pennsylvanians provide this care, whether in the workplace, at home, or in our communities. Sometimes caregiving is a vocation, as is the case for workers such as some nursing home aides and physicians. But it can also be a long-term responsibility like caring for family members, including aging parents or partners with medical complications. Or it can be a temporary role such as driving an older adult to appointments or babysitting a friend’s kids.

Some people inhabit all these roles at once.

To give a picture of caregiving’s broad reach, How We Care looked at information from the U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other sources to compile data on the different populations within Pennsylvania who rely on and provide care to others. This is not a complete account of care in the commonwealth, but it sheds light on how ubiquitous and essential this work is. These data also show some of the pay, gender, and health inequities in caregiving that influence the quality of care.
