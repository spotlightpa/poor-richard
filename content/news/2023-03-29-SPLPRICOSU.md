HARRISBURG — In May, Democrats and Republicans will choose their parties’ candidates for three vacant seats on Commonwealth and Superior Courts. The winners will compete in the November general election.

Pennsylvania’s two intermediate appellate courts have the power to affirm or reverse decisions made in lower courts. Their rulings can be appealed to the state Supreme Court, Pennsylvania’s court of last resort.

The person who wins the open seat on Commonwealth Court could help shape Pennsylvania’s laws on everything from elections to firearms, while the two candidates who win seats on Superior Court could decide the outcomes of high-profile criminal cases. Judges on both courts are often top candidates to fill openings on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

The two intermediate appellate courts serve distinct roles in the commonwealth’s legal system.

Commonwealth Court presides over civil actions brought by and against the Pennsylvania state government and hears appeals primarily in cases involving state departments and local governments. Superior Court handles criminal, family, and civil cases that are appealed by county Courts of Common Pleas.

Not all voters will be able to participate in the upcoming judicial primaries, which will be held May 16. Pennsylvania is one of nine states that has closed primaries, which prevent third-party and unaffiliated voters from participating in partisan elections. (Unaffiliated and third-party voters can, however, vote on ballot questions, other referendums, and special elections during a primary.)

Pennsylvania is <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/judicial-selection-map">one of a handful of states</a> that elect judges in partisan contests, meaning candidates run under the banner of a political party, collect endorsements, and raise money.

There are <a href="http://ethics.pacourts.us/electionfaq.htm">a few key differences</a> between a judicial election and other political elections in the commonwealth, however. Prospective judges can’t directly ask for donations, though their campaign committees can. They also can’t make promises that they’ll rule in certain ways.

Because judicial elections tend to have relatively low voter turnout, and because judges have less direct contact with the public than local representatives, party endorsements can be a powerful determinant of who wins a judicial primary.

Ratings from the Pennsylvania Bar Association can be similarly important. The bar ranks judicial candidates as “highly recommended,” “recommended,” or “not recommended” <a href="http://pavotesmart.com/ratings-criteria/">based on</a> the candidate’s judicial record and interviews with a judicial evaluation commission.

Spotlight PA has noted these rankings, as well as other key details, in its profiles of the candidates:

# Commonwealth Court

The nine-member Commonwealth Court is the first stop for many high-profile cases.

Recent rulings include <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/pa-mail-voting-court-ruling-unconstitutional-whats-next/">a 2022 decision</a> that found the state’s mail voting law unconstitutional — a decision later overruled by the state Supreme Court — and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/02/pa-public-school-funding-lawsuit-state-budget-billions/">a February opinion</a> that found the state’s education funding system violated the rights of parents and students in poorer districts.

Judges serve initial 10-year terms, then face a nonpartisan retention vote, which usually succeeds.

There is one seat open on Commonwealth Court this year, and both parties’ primaries have multiple candidates vying for the nomination. The court currently has five judges who were elected as Republicans and three elected as Democrats.

<a href="https://www.princeforjustice.com/" target="_blank"><b>Joshua Prince</b></a>

A Berks County lawyer and Widener University law school graduate, Prince runs a firm that specializes in gun-related litigation.

Prince has sued the city of Harrisburg to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-gun-politics-harrisburg-e55a37a31ec6d6e1f82526e7009cd1c2">block the enforcement</a> of old gun laws, and sued the state and federal governments to block bans on <a href="https://www.firearmspolicy.org/lawsuit-challenging-trump-bump-stock-ban">bump stocks</a> and partial firearm frames that lack identifying information, which opponents have labeled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/police-pennsylvania-lawsuits-gun-politics-af013cd0d14c2e28d4669c35db8f6359">“ghost guns.”</a>

He has the endorsement of a handful of conservative rank-and-file GOP lawmakers, county sheriffs, and gun rights groups, including Firearms Owners Against Crime.

In February, Prince attended a Susquehanna County Republicans <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SusquehannaGOP/posts/pfbid0A6H2kQSigzDHB34a7d88rRf6mR7EgEYwS4LFyZnzQEH4psfJaxQfU3YCTjYJ4d29l">event</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02GDkkJsCy6kZ1C8R4GjmXC6n2i5Rs3aEqR4D47btQCgRH4D41ntoSiwZhjnY1wzW3l&id=100007541119284">posed for a group photo</a> that included Frank Scavo, a <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/republican-state-house-candidate-shared-clinton-conspiracy-theory-on-facebook/">former Republican legislative candidate</a> who was <a href="https://www.wnep.com/amp/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/frank-scavo-sentenced-to-prison-for-role-in-capitol-riot-federal-court-old-forge/523-f350908f-15d2-4a33-9b46-78a96f7c6103">sentenced to 60 days in prison</a> for participating in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. GOP state Supreme Court candidate Patricia McCullough was also in the photo.

Prince told Spotlight PA that he wasn’t aware of Scavo’s background when he took the photo.

“It is impossible to know everyone’s personal background from a 1-minute interaction,” he said.

Prince is not recommended by the state bar association, which <a href="https://www.pabar.org/site/News-and-Publications/News/News-Releases/2023/Feb/Pennsylvania-Bar-Association-Judicial-Evaluation-Commission-Releases-Second-Round-of-2023-Ratings-for-Potential-Candidates-to-Fill-Seats-on-Pennsylvania-Appellate-Courts">found</a> that he “lacks the depth and breadth of experience and preparation necessary to take on the commanding role of judge on the Commonwealth Court.”

In an email, Prince said he disagreed with his rating and <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/the-pa-bar-association-carefully-creates-judicial-candidate-ratings-but-do-they-actually-serve-voters/">pointed to the success of candidates</a> who didn’t have the group’s blessing.

“I have confidence voters will once again see that a single organizational endorsement is not the full measure of a candidate, and that they will base their decision on the totality of actual experience, especially in the courtroom,” Prince said.

# Superior Court

The 15-member Superior Court handles all nongovernment-related criminal and civil cases. Primary voters will pick two candidates from their own party; the two Democrats and the two Republicans with the most votes will move on to the November general election.

The panel’s main role is to review lower courts’ verdicts. Notable recent decisions include <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/meek-mill-conviction-overturned-cleared-larry-krasner-philadelphia-20190724.html">a 2019 opinion</a> tossing out rapper Meek Mills’s conviction on drug and gun charges.

Judges serve initial 10-year terms, then face nonpartisan retention votes, which usually succeed.

There are two open seats on Superior Court this year. Its partisan makeup is currently split, with seven Democrats and seven Republicans. The president judge of the court is selected through a vote by members of the Superior Court and serves a five-year term.

### Republican candidates

{{<picture src="external/1nfzfmwn4bqc5x9a4ba6v9t3pr.png" description="Maria Battista" caption="Maria Battista" credit="Via candidate website">}}

{{<picture src="external/xmkazn9etgb1jj7xbasqqn9rng.png" description="Harry Smail" caption="Harry Smail" credit="Via candidate website">}} 

<a href="https://votejudgesmail.com/" target="_blank"><b>Harry Smail</b></a>

Smail has been a Westmoreland County Common Pleas judge since former Republican Gov. Tom Corbett appointed him to the bench in 2014. Before that, he was a private practice attorney who ran unsuccessfully for numerous county offices. He received his law degree from Duquesne University.

He is endorsed by the state Republican Party. On its website, the party points to rulings Smail made in 2020 “that upheld essential anti-fraud requirements for casting a mail-in ballot.”

That year, Smail ruled against the Westmoreland County Board of Elections in a case brought by a Republican candidate for state Senate in an extremely close race.

He ordered the board to <a href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/westmoreland-judge-tosses-more-than-200-ballots-elections-board-wanted-counted/">throw out</a> 204 provisional ballots — those that are cast when a person’s registration cannot be immediately verified — it wanted to count. Those 204 provisional ballots were cast by people who were wrongly told by election workers that they also needed to sign their precinct’s pollbook. By signing the book, the voters instead indicated they cast a ballot using a voting machine.

<script src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version="1" data-spl-src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/donate/"></div>


Smail ruled that the board of elections did not conduct due diligence in accepting those 204 votes without “further substantiating evidence” that they hadn’t voted twice.

“While the Court is loath to impose the consequences of a failure of the Board onto an innocent electorate … the court must apply the provisions of the Elections Code consistently and as written by our legislature,” Smail <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/Storage/media/pdfs/20210604/011455-file-10674.pdf">wrote</a> in the 12-page decision.

The bar rated Smail “recommended,” “based on his extensive background, legal ability and temperament.”
