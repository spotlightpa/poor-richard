HARRISBURG — <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/topics/josh-shapiro/">Gov. Josh Shapiro</a>, a top contender to be Kamala Harris’ running mate, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/josh-shapiro-vice-president-school-choice-voucher/">supports</a> creating a taxpayer-funded school voucher program in Pennsylvania.

These programs route public money to pay for student tuition at private and religious schools, and they’re becoming more common around the country. <strong></strong>

Here in Pennsylvania, Republicans broadly support creating a voucher program, while most Democrats oppose such an idea.

Proponents argue they give children attending struggling public schools crucial options, while opponents say they weaken public schools by diverting funding and don’t necessarily help students. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/06/school-choice-voucher-public-pennsylvania-budget-conflict/">Studies have shown</a> that their effects are mixed.

With almost no middle ground between the opposing sides, research and studies can give the public insight into how a voucher program would work here in Pennsylvania and how others have performed elsewhere.

Spotlight PA held a free panel discussion on this research, the politics of the issue, and what has been proposed in Pennsylvania.

<strong>Our panelists included:</strong>

- <strong>Katie Meyer,</strong> government reporter and editor, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Patrick Wolf,</strong> head of Department of Education Reform, University of Arkansas

- <strong>Anthony Williams</strong>, state senator, serving parts of Delaware County and Philadelphia

- <strong>Susan Spicka</strong>, executive director, Education Voters of PA
