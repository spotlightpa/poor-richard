Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been hospitalized and is “doing well” after a fall in which he hit his head and got “minor injuries,” his office announced on Thursday.

A spokesperson said in a statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1989026864862507493?s=20">Fetterman’s social media</a> that the senator had chosen to stay at a Pittsburgh hospital “so doctors can fine-tune his medication regimen” and receive “routine observation.” The incident occurred during a morning walk in which he got light headed.

“If you thought my face looked bad before, wait until you see it now!” Fetterman said in the statement.

It’s the latest in a long saga of health issues and hospitalizations for Fetterman<strong>, </strong>which have raised questions <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/john-fetterman-struggle-mental-health-clinical-depression.html">about his ability to serve</a> as a senator. Fetterman has struggled with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/04/john-fetterman-ignored-heart-condition-stroke">health issues for several years</a>, including during his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/04/john-fetterman-ignored-heart-condition-stroke">2022</a> campaign, during which he suffered a major stroke.

The stroke left him with an auditory processing disorder, and he now uses closed captioning on a small tablet to read speech in real time.

He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/us/politics/john-fetterman-hospital-depression.html">spoken openly</a> about his struggles with chronic depression, for which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/us/politics/john-fetterman-hospital-depression.html">he was hospitalized in 2023</a> for six weeks.

Fetterman, who represents a crucial battleground state, is a lawmaker who is often at odds with his party. He’s grown <a href="https://www.notus.org/senate/john-fetterman-peter-welch-senate">increasingly isolated</a> in the Senate, and though he often votes with Democrats, he is vocal when he does not.

Most recently<strong>, </strong>Fetterman voted alongside Republicans to reopen the government as other Democrats held out. His support has <a href="https://www.notus.org/pennsylvania/john-fetterman-democratic-party-big-tent">increased among Pennsylvania Republicans</a> and tanked among state Democrats over this and his votes to confirm some of President Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees.

His recent voting pattern has tested the support of Democrats, but many of his <a href="https://www.notus.org/pennsylvania/john-fetterman-democratic-party-big-tent">colleagues on the left insist</a> that the party’s “tent” is better with Fetterman in it.<strong></strong>
