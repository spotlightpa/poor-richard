<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

Huge stories will shape Pennsylvania’s future next year.

With a new administration in the governor’s office and a shift in power in the state legislature, major policy decisions that affect all of our lives could lie ahead. But no matter the issue or party or politician in office, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/">Spotlight PA</a> will never stop demanding the truth and accountability.

So as you consider the causes and organizations to support this year, I ask you to invest in quality journalism that demands the truth, holds leaders accountable, and gets results. And <a href="/donate?campaign=7015G000001Z7ovQAC">there’s no better time to do it than today</a>, Giving Tuesday, or as we call it, Giving News Day.

If you’re not yet familiar with our work, Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom covering the state Capitol in Harrisburg and urgent statewide issues. We are the largest statewide newsroom in Pennsylvania, and we are also the most unique.

We don’t endorse candidates, take policy positions, identify with any political party or ideology, or publish any opinion or editorial pieces. But we do stand for certain universal values:

1. We believe the more people who know how our government works and how to participate, including the more people who vote, the stronger our state will be.

2. We believe we, the taxpayers, have a right to know how our government spends our money.

3. We believe our government should be open and transparent with records and information about what it’s doing in our name, and how well it’s going.

4. We believe those given the privilege to represent Pennsylvania in whatever political forum should act honestly, ethically, and legally.

5. And we believe free and unfettered investigative and public-service journalism is a fundamental pillar of a strong state, country, and democracy.

At Spotlight PA, we don’t make our decisions about which stories to write based on how many clicks they might get or how sensational they might be. We put the good of Pennsylvania first, and deliver deep, contextual stories that you won’t find anywhere else.

That’s also why we make all of our journalism available at no cost as a public service. Not only do we publish our articles on our website, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/">spotlightpa.org</a>, but we also share our work with 90+ community news outlets across the state, including this one that you’re reading right now.

How do we have the time and resources to do such important work? That’s thanks to you.

Our journalism and the future of Spotlight PA depend on your support. Make a tax-deductible gift of any amount at <a href="/donate?campaign=7015G000001Z7ovQAC">spotlightpa.org/donate</a>, and as a special bonus, <b>all contributions will be TRIPLED</b> thanks to a matching gift from a generous donor.

At Spotlight PA, we’re bringing journalism back to its roots — a public service fighting for you in the halls of power, tracking your tax dollars, and driving positive change. This is journalism worth supporting, and I hope I can count on you to ensure Spotlight PA can continue to thrive in 2023.
