HARRISBURG — The Nov. 5 general election in Pennsylvania is quickly approaching. If you still have questions about where your polling place is, who is on the ballot, and how to vote, Spotlight PA has got you covered.

Voters across the commonwealth will cast their ballots for president, U.S. House and Senate, Pennsylvania’s three statewide row offices (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and state House and Senate. Depending on where you live, there might also be local ballot questions.

Here’s a last-minute checklist of everything you’ll need to vote.

First, the basics:

- Make sure you’re registered. You can check your voter registration status <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">on the Pennsylvania Department of State website</a>. Unfortunately, if you’re not already registered, it’s too late to vote in this election cycle.

- It also is too late to request a mail ballot if you haven’t already. If you have, you can track your mail ballot on the <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of State&#39;s election ballot status webpage</a>. To be counted, your county election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Postmarks do not count. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/08/pennsylvania-general-election-2024-mail-ballot-how-to-request-fill-out-return/">Read more about mail ballots and how to properly fill them out</a>.

- If you plan to vote in person, you can find your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">online</a>.

- If it’s your first time voting at your polling location, you need to bring a form of valid ID such as a driver’s license, a passport, or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, there are various options you can bring, including a current utility bill or bank statement. You can find the full list of acceptable IDs <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">on Pennsylvania&#39;s official election website</a>.
