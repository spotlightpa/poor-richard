## Pa. Superior Court 101

The Superior Court of Pennsylvania is one of the commonwealth’s two intermediate appellate courts. Established in 1895, the court is made up of 15 judges and handles criminal, civil, and family cases that are appealed from lower courts such as the Courts of Common Pleas.

Decisions from Superior Court make news less often than those from the other two appellate courts, but it is the statewide court with which an average Pennsylvanian is likeliest to interact. Cases involving child custody, probation and parole, and business disputes can all end up in front of this court, and while those cases can be reversed by the state Supreme Court, this<a href="https://www.pacourts.us/learn/"> rarely happens in practice</a>.

The court also has a reputation as <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/a-voter-guide-to-pennsylvanias-2021-judicial-elections-2/">one of the busiest appellate benches</a> in the nation. Its judges, who typically hear cases in three-person panels, are elected to 10-year terms in partisan contests and subsequently face nonpartisan retention votes, which usually succeed.

There is currently an even partisan split on Superior Court, with seven Democrats, seven Republicans, and one vacancy. One sitting Republican, Judge John T. Bender, will leave the bench this year when he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Voters selected Democrats Jill Beck and Timika Lane <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-election-2023-results-superior-court-maria-battista-jill-beck-timika-lane-harry-smail/">to fill two seats</a> during this fall’s election. They will be sworn in this January

Judge Daniel McCaffery is slated to leave Superior Court early next year. McCaffery, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-election-results-supreme-court-daniel-mccaffery-carolyn-carluccio/">won a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> in November 2023; he will be sworn in this January.

McCaffery’s departure will leave a vacancy on the bench. The governor can appoint a person to fill that spot with approval from the GOP-controlled state Senate. The seat will also appear on the 2025 ballot.
