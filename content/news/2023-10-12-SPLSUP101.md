## Pa. Superior Court 101

The Superior Court of Pennsylvania is one of the commonwealth’s two intermediate appellate courts. Established in 1895, the court is made up of 15 judges and handles criminal, civil, and family cases that are appealed from lower courts such as the Courts of Common Pleas.

Decisions from Superior Court make news less often than those from the other two appellate courts, but it is the statewide court with which an average Pennsylvanian is likeliest to interact. Cases involving child custody, probation and parole, and business disputes can all end up in front of this court, and while those cases can be reversed by the state Supreme Court, this<a href="https://www.pacourts.us/learn/"> rarely happens in practice</a>.

The court also has a reputation as <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/a-voter-guide-to-pennsylvanias-2021-judicial-elections-2/">one of the busiest appellate benches</a> in the nation. Its judges, who typically hear cases in three-person panels, are elected to 10-year terms in partisan contests and subsequently face nonpartisan retention votes, which usually succeed.

The court currently has eight judges elected as Democrats and six as Republicans, plus one vacancy.

One seat on the court has been open since Judge Daniel McCaffery<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-election-results-supreme-court-daniel-mccaffery-carolyn-carluccio/"> was elected to the state Supreme Court in 2023</a>.

In the upcoming Nov. 4 election, voters will choose to elect Democrat Brandon Neuman or Republican Maria Battista to fill that vacancy. They will also decide whether Judge Alice Beck Dubow, who was elected as a Democrat, will continue to serve on the bench.
