From the <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dcnr/conservation/forests-and-tree/fall-foliage-reports">vibrant foliage</a> to the <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/pittsburgh/2025/09/09/pennsylvania-pumpkin-production-2024">prolific pumpkin production</a>, Pennsylvania‚Äôs fall vibes are strong. The sheer abundance of autumnal activities can make it difficult to choose exactly how to enjoy the season, though.

Worry not! Spotlight PA has put together a short quiz to help you decide how to spend your fall weekends, based on your own mood and preferences. There are a dozen possible outcomes, with many of them highlighting our staffers‚Äô favorite fall spots around the commonwealth.

The quiz takes just one minute to complete. If you don‚Äôt like your result or want to get even more ideas for a weekend excursion, you can refresh the page and retake it as many times as you‚Äôd like.
