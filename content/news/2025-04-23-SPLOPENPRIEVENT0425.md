Pennsylvania is one of just 10 states with closed primaries, which means that only voters registered with the Democratic or Republican party can vote in those parties’ primary elections.

Opening the state’s primaries to independent and third-party voters has been a long-standing conversation among state lawmakers, voters, and advocates. However, despite repeated introduction, bills that would do so have never made it into law.

Open primaries would allow 1.4 million independent and third-party Pennsylvanians to participate more fully in elections, and some advocates say the move could reduce hyperpartisanship. But county election officials also warn that the change would likely put more strain on their systems and workers. <strong></strong>

To unpack the issue, join us Tuesday, May 6 from 6-7 p.m. on Zoom for a live conversation about how open primaries would impact Pennsylvania, what we can learn from other states, and where the conversation stands in the legislature.

<strong>Our speakers</strong>:

- <strong>Kate Huangpu,</strong> government reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Jennifer Bullock</strong>, founder, Independent Pennsylvanians

- <strong>Thad Hall,</strong> elections director, Mercer County

- <strong>Jared Solomon</strong>, Democratic state House representative
