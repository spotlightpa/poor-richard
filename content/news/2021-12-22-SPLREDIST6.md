The long-awaited state House and Senate redistricting maps are finally here and could dramatically alter the balance of power in Pennsylvania. 

Republicans currently hold a 113-90 advantage in the House, but the new map creates about 102 districts that lean Democratic, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-state-house-map-score-analysis/">opening the possibility of control of the chamber shifting for the first time in at least a decade</a>. The composition of the Senate, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-state-senate-map-analysis-score/">is less likely to change under the preliminary plan</a>.

The redrawing of the districts will also affect the political sway of communities of color, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/11/pa-redistricting-latino-representation-political-power/">which have driven Pennsylvania’s population growth over the past decade</a>. The public comment period for these maps — <a href="https://www.redistricting.state.pa.us/commission/article/1087">which ends next month</a> — offers these communities a rare chance to shape their political future in the state.

On Thursday, Jan. 6 at noon EST, Spotlight PA held a free panel on the newly released state House and Senate maps, how the maps could shift political power, and their potential impact on Pennsylvanians.

Our panelists included:

- <b>Kate Huangpu</b>, redistricting reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Carol Kuniholm</b>, chairperson for Fair Districts PA

- <b>Victor Martinez</b>, on-air talent for Mega 106.9 FM
