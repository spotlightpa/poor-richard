HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s 2024 primary Election Day is quickly approaching. If you still have questions about where your polling place is, who is on the ballot, and how to vote, Spotlight PA has got you covered.

On Tuesday, April 23, voters across the commonwealth will determine which candidates go on to run in the general election. On the ballot are candidates for president, U.S. House and Senate, Pennsylvania’s three row offices (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and state House and Senate. Across the state, depending on where you live, there might also be local ballot questions.

Before you submit your ballot, here’s a last-minute checklist of everything you’ll need to vote.

First, the basics:

- Make sure you’re registered. You can check your voter registration status <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">on the Pennsylvania Department of State website</a>. Unfortunately, if you’re not already registered, it’s too late to vote in this election cycle.

- It also is too late to request a mail ballot if you haven’t already. If you have, you can track your mail ballot on the <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of State&#39;s election ballot status webpage</a>. To be counted, your ballot must be received by your county election office by 8 p.m. on primary Election Day. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/04/pennsylvania-primary-election-2024-mail-ballot-how-to-request-fill-out-return/">Read more about mail ballots and how to properly fill them out</a>.

- In Pennsylvania, if you are registered as an independent, you cannot vote for candidates in the primary election because we have a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/04/pennsylvania-primary-election-2024-open-primaries-independent-third-party-voters/">closed primary system</a>, meaning only registered Democrats and Republicans can vote in their respective party&#39;s primary.

- If you plan to vote in person, you can find your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">online</a>.

- You need to bring a form of ID such as a driver’s license or a passport if it’s your first time voting at your polling location. You can find the full list of acceptable IDs <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">on Pennsylvania&#39;s official election website</a>.

- For general voting and election resources, check out Spotlight PA’s <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/elections">2024 Election Center</a>. We have candidate guides for <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-election-2024-auditor-general-candidates-tim-defoor-malcolm-kenyatta-mark-pinsley/">auditor general</a>, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-election-2024-attorney-general-primary-candidates/">attorney general</a>, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-election-2024-treasurer-primary-candidates-stacy-garrity-ryan-bizzarro-erin-mcclelland/">treasurer</a>. We also <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/elections-2024/candidate-quiz/">have a quiz</a> to help you figure out which attorney general candidate best aligns with your values.
