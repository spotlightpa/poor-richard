HARRISBURG — With just over a month to go until the May primary election of 2022, the nine candidates vying for the Republican nomination for governor have collectively raised more than $13 million.

Some of their campaigns have been fueled primarily by small donations of $25 to $250. Others have benefited from multimillion-dollar infusions of cash. Yet others have poured millions of dollars of their own money into their campaign war chests in the hopes of pulling ahead of the pack, according to the <a href="https://www.campaignfinanceonline.pa.gov/Pages/CFReportSearch.aspx" target="_blank">latest campaign finance reports</a>.

That money has helped them crisscross the state, hit the television airwaves, cut digital ads, print mailers, and pay steep salaries to a bevy of consultants and campaign finance advisers.

Though the race to lure more and bigger donors is only expected to intensify as the May 17 primary draws closer, it appears unlikely to shatter records. Pennsylvania in recent years has made national headlines for its expensive primary contests for governor — at least on the Democratic side.

In 2014, for instance, Tom Wolf edged out three opponents in a primary race that cost $36.6 million. He eventually won the general election. Before that, the bruising primary between former Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell and now Sen. Bob Casey cost an eye-popping <a href="https://old.post-gazette.com/election/20020522govrace0522p1.asp">$30 million</a>.

This year’s general election, however, could quickly <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/01/pa-likely-to-shatter-80-million-record-for-spending-in-a-governors-race.html">make history</a> when it comes to spending.

The Republican candidate who emerges victorious in the primary will face state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is running unopposed. As the Republicans have fought for campaign superiority, Shapiro began the year with <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/02/shapiro-sets-campaign-cash-record-to-start-election-year-dave-white-jake-corman-lead-republicans-in-fundraising.html">$13.4 million on hand</a> — and raised an additional $4.5 million in the first three months of this year. (<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/04/pa-election-day-2022-primary-josh-shapiro-fundraising" target="_blank">Read Spotlight PA’s analysis of Shapiro’s donors</a>.)

Here’s what we know about the Republican field’s donors, based on their most recent campaign finance reports covering the first three months of 2022 (the next report is due in early May):

## Lou Barletta

Cash raised overall: $1.3 million

Cash raised in 2022: $430,745

Cash on hand: $356,292

Top donors who gave at least $25,000 at one time:

- Change PA PAC ($198,000)

- Norman Arthur Dick ($30,800)

- Restore The Dream ($30,000)

- Where America Started ($30,000)

Barletta, the former mayor of Hazleton and an ex-U.S. representative, has received the most money from a likely source: Change PA PAC, a political action committee that he <a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1299901/barletta-launches-pac-still-considering-run-for-governor">launched last year</a> as he was mulling a run for governor.

Change PA did not get contributions this year. In 2021, the biggest donors were Jodey Mutchler and Richard Mutchler, the president of the pharmaceutical firm Biospectra, who gave $100,000.

To Barletta’s current campaign, Norman Arthur Dick, who runs a kitchen and bathroom products company in Mountain Top, contributed $30,800 in two donations. Tied for third are two political action committees: Restore The Dream and Where America Started. Each donated $30,000.

<a href="https://twitter.com/restoredreampac">Restore The Dream</a> is chaired by G. Reeder Patton II, whose family runs an indoor sports complex center in Harrisburg. Going back to 2018, it was affiliated with the political action committee of onetime gubernatorial candidate Paul Mango. The PAC has not raised money since 2018, when Mango made his unsuccessful run for governor, but it donated the majority of the money it had left to Barletta.

Where America Started received its largest donations last year from executives from construction, coal, and real estate companies.

Barletta also received $36,000 in an in-kind donation from James Ertle of Ertle Subaru in Stroudsburg.

## Jake Corman

Cash raised overall: $2.8 million

Cash raised in 2022: $589,627

Cash on hand: $270,846

Top donors who gave at least $25,000 at one time:

- Galen E. Dreibelbis ($100,000)

Corman, a state senator from Centre County, has received multiple six-figure donations over the last 15 months. His largest contributor was the political action committee of Bryn Mawr’s University City Housing Co. The company is run by Michael Karp, a major Philadelphia-area real estate developer.

Tied for second place are five donors who have each given Corman $100,000: State Sen. John DiSanto’s political action committee; Galen E. Dreibelbis, a commercial and residential real-estate developer in Centre County who formerly served in the state legislature; Laura M. Pegula, a geologist and daughter of Terry Pegula, a Pennsylvania State University alumnus who runs a multimillion-dollar energy industry acquisition company; Sandra L. Poole, a designer with a Centre County home-building company run by her husband, Robert Poole; and hotel developer, owner, and operator Lance Shaner.

His third-largest donor is a political action committee called Where America Started. The PAC’s largest donors last year were executives from construction, coal, and real estate companies.

Corman has also moved $200,00 from his senatorial PAC, Friends of Jake Corman, to support his gubernatorial bid. His mother has also lent his campaign $90,000.

He has also received sizable donations from David E. Barensfeld, board chair of Commonwealth Partners, a conservative advocacy group.

The Commonwealth Leaders Fund — a political action committee founded by prominent conservative Matthew Brouillette and funded in large part by billionaire Jeffrey Yass — has bet big on McSwain, donating almost $6 million in TV and digital ads as well as other items like mailers. These are known as in-kind donations.

White on his campaign website says he worked for “decades as a union pipefitter,” and he has also seen large donations from PACs associated with that industry.

The candidate himself, with his wife, Debra Ann, has lent his campaign $4 million, according to his most recent report.
