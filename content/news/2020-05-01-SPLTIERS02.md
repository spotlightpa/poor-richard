### PHASE YELLOW

In this phase, state officials will ease some restrictions and allow more businesses to open, but customers can still expect mitigation efforts such as curbside pickup/delivery only and potential limitations on the number of people allowed in store. Closures of schools, gyms, and other indoor recreation centers, hair and nail salons, as well as limitations around large gatherings, remain in place.

<b>Workplace restrictions</b>

- Telework must continue where feasible

- Businesses with in-person operations must follow business and building safety orders

- Child care open complying with guidance

- Congregate care and prison restrictions in place

- Schools remain closed for in-person instruction

<b>Social restrictions</b>

- Large gatherings of more than 25 prohibited

- In-person retail allowable, curbside and delivery preferable

- Indoor recreation, health and wellness facilities and personal care services (such as gyms, spas, hair salons, nail salons and other entities that provide massage therapy), and all entertainment (such as casinos, theaters) remain closed

- Restaurants and cars limited to carry-out and delivery only

### PHASE GREEN

This phase removes all restrictions placed upon business operations and social guidelines, though safety guidelines implemented by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Health must be followed. This phase is considered the “new normal.”

<b>Workplace restrictions</b>

- All businesses must follow CDC and PA Department of Health guidelines

<b>Social restrictions</b>
