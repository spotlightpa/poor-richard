<i><b>Updated, May 27</b></i>

HARRISBURG — As some counties prepare to enter the “green” phase of Pennsylvania’s tiered reopening plan, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration has updated its guidance on what residents in those areas can and can’t do.

Officials have also announced that limited outdoor dining will be allowed in the more restrictive “yellow” phase staring June 5. By that date, the entire state is <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/05/pennsylvania-yellow-phase-counties-june-5/" target=_blank>expected to be in that phase</a>.

Under the new guidance, bars and restaurants may serve customers outside if:

- Customers are seated at tables only

- Customers wear masks unless seated

- Tables are placed at least six feet apart

- The facility limits occupancy

Here’s more on what you can expect in each phase.
