Gov. Tom Wolf on Thursday evening will announce that he is extending his shutdown order to apply to all but “life-sustaining” businesses as the novel coronavirus continues to spread.

The governor had previously asked nonessential businesses such as salons, theaters, and entertainment venues to close. Life-sustaining businesses that may continue <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20200319-Life-Sustaining-Business.pdf">physical operations</a> include gas stations, farms, health care facilities, and transit systems, according to the Wolf administration.

Restaurants and bars were previously required to stop all dine-in services.

“Enforcement actions will be taken against non-life sustaining businesses that are out of compliance effective March 21, 2020, at 12:01 a.m.,” according to an order signed by Wolf.
