{{<featured/dropcap>}}The judges you elect this November will have a profound impact on some of the most pressing and hot-button issues of our time, including abortion, civil liberties, education, voting and elections, the environment, and more. But their impact isn’t always readily apparent.{{</featured/dropcap>}}

That’s why Spotlight PA has created this new voter tool showcasing how judges and the courts have affected policy over the past several years. 

On Nov. 7, Pennsylvania voters will be asked to pick new judges to sit on state Supreme, Superior, and Commonwealth Courts.

Judges on these courts are elected in statewide, partisan elections that often don’t have high turnout. Once on the court, judges often stay there for decades — interpreting state laws, striking them down completely, and determining guilt and punishments. 

To illustrate how decisions from Pennsylvania’s appellate courts impact residents, we collected some of the most relevant and important cases across a range of issues to showcase what the court receives and how it makes its decisions on everything from paid sick leave to legislative districts to gun control.

### WHY IT MATTERS: 

A rule prevents people who have state-issued insurance from using it to pay for an abortion. 

### SUMMARY: 

A group of abortion providers is suing the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to challenge a law, passed in 1982, that prevents the state from using public dollars to cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person. 

Commonwealth Court ruled against the petitioners in March 2021, saying it was bound by a 1985 state Supreme Court decision that found the 1982 law was constitutional. 

The petitioners appealed to the state Supreme Court, which accepted the case and heard oral arguments in November 2022. A final ruling is still pending as of September 2023.
