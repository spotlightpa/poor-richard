Frida Liu’s life is not what she expected. The protagonist in Jessamine Chan’s bestselling novel, <em>The School for Good Mothers</em>, is struggling in her career and marriage. Her only solace is her daughter. But when the government takes her, Frida must prove through a series of trials that she is fit to be a mother.

As part of Spotlight PA’s new book club pilot, Booklight PA, we’re reading Chan’s debut novel and discussing it with readers across the state on Discord. (<a href="https://discord.gg/EdvwWzzy"><strong>Join now</strong></a><strong>!</strong>) Then, on Sept. 25 from 6 to 7 p.m., Chan will join us via Zoom to answer your questions on her Philly-based novel.

<em>The School for Good Mothers </em>made the New York Times Best Seller list, was chosen as a “Today” show book club pick, and was longlisted for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel and the Carnegie Medal.

This event is in partnership with A Novel Idea, a community-minded bookstore and event space based in East Passyunk, Philadelphia, run by Alexander Schneider and Christina Rosso-Schneider.
