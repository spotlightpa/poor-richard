Frida Liu’s life is not what she expected. The protagonist in Jessamine Chan’s bestselling novel, <em>The School for Good Mothers</em>, is struggling in her career and marriage. Her only solace is her daughter. But when the government takes her, Frida must prove through a series of trials that she is fit to be a mother.

As part of Spotlight PA’s new book club pilot, Booklight PA, we read Chan’s debut novel and discussed it with readers across the state on Discord. (<a href="https://discord.gg/UndEthCM">Join now</a>!) Then, on Sept. 25, Chan joined us via Zoom to answer your questions on her Philly-based novel.

<em>The School for Good Mothers </em>made the New York Times Best Seller list, was chosen as a “Today” show book club pick, and was longlisted for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel and the Carnegie Medal.

This event was in partnership with <a href="https://anovelideaphilly.com/book-list/">A Novel Idea</a>, a community-minded bookstore and event space based in East Passyunk, Philadelphia, run by Alexander Schneider and Christina Rosso-Schneider. <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/spotlight-pa-book-club">Purchase your books here</a> and <a href="https://libro.fm/playlists/10229?bookstore=anovelideaphilly">find audiobook versions here</a>.
