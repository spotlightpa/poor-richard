The 2021 Pennsylvania election is here, and Spotlight PA wants to make sure you have everything you need to vote, starting with when polls open in the state and how to find your polling location. Here’s answers to our most frequently asked questions:

- <b>When do polls open in Pa.?</b> 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. *If you’re in line by 8 p.m., you can vote.

- <b>Where do I vote?</b> Confirm your polling location <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">here</a>.

- <b>Am I registered to vote?</b> Check <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">here</a>.

- <b>Do I need a photo ID?</b> Only if you’re voting at a polling place for <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Voting-in-PA/Pages/First-Time-Voters.aspx">the first time</a>.

- <b>What about my mail ballot?</b> The county elections office needs to receive it by 8 p.m. on Election Day (aka Tuesday, Nov. 2). The postmark doesn’t count! If you haven’t already mailed it, you need to drop it off in person at your county elections office. Find the location <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Resources/Pages/Contact-Your-Election-Officials.aspx">here</a>.

- <b>Are drop-boxes available?</b> Yes, but availability depends on location. Philadelphia, for example, has <a href="https://billypenn.com/2021/10/23/philadelphia-mail-ballot-drop-box-map-november-election/">more than a dozen</a>. Allegheny County has <a href="https://triblive.com/local/allegheny-county-scraps-remote-drop-boxes-for-mail-in-voters-councilwoman-hallam-pushes-to-bring-them-back/">just one</a>. Find a definitive list <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Return-Ballot.aspx">here</a>.

- <b>What’s a “naked” ballot?</b> Mail ballots come with two envelopes. A “naked” mail ballot is missing its inner secrecy envelope and won’t be counted under Pennsylvania law. Follow <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx#:~:text=Below%20are%20general,deliver%20their%20ballot.">these instructions</a> carefully.
