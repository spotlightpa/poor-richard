<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, non-partisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News and other news organizations across Pennsylvania. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>

Spotlight PA is creating a diverse source database as a resource for Pennsylvania journalists, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVh7CFSaKc5H7VTWcizw1sxmC8XQfWZ_yerww6SvWad5vmQQ/viewform">we’re seeking recommendations, tips, and suggestions</a> for Pa.-based experts of color who should be considered.

Amid the national conversation about race, equity, and inclusion, Pennsylvania’s newsrooms are grappling with their own history of discrimination and systemic racism in staffing and coverage.

Historically, journalists have tended to amplify white voices over others in their stories. Spotlight PA’s diverse source database seeks to change that and ensure our local and statewide news coverage is more equitable and better reflects the communities we serve.

The project is being overseen by <a href="https://twitter.com/itistamara">Tamara Dunn</a>, a freelance writer and former night news editor of the Times Leader in Wilkes-Barre. It was made possible by a grant from the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association Foundation Fellows Fund for the Future.

The database – which will be free and available to all – will include a minimum of 100 Pennsylvania-based experts of color organized by area of expertise. We won't publish any of the nominated source's information without their consent.
