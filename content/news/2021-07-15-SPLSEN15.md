One of Pennsylvania’s two U.S. Senate seats is up for grabs in 2022 as two-term Republican incumbent Pat Toomey prepares to step aside and the state braces for a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/06/pa-2020-governor-race-candidates/">particularly high-stakes election year</a>.

The Senate opening has drawn plenty of interest from Democrats looking to shore up a narrow congressional majority, Republicans looking to limit key aspects of the Biden agenda, and observers believing the seat is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/05/politics/2022-senate-race-rankings-july/index.html">likely to flip</a> or <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">too close to call</a>. The race will be exceedingly expensive either way.

Now that a deadline for filing paperwork to get on a May 17 primary ballot has passed, these are the candidates moving forward in those contests.
