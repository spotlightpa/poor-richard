Before the rise of the internet, Pennsylvania’s queer community connected through underground newsletters, newspapers, zines, and hotlines. The media wave started in big cities, like Philadelphia, but soon spread to much smaller communities statewide.

The discussion below focuses on that movement, the players, and the accompanying risks, all ahead of an upcoming retrospective on the subject hosted by the LGBT Center of Central Pennsylvania History Project. Watch it.

<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>

- <strong>Colin Deppen</strong>, newsletter editor, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Barry Loveland</strong>, chair, LGBT Center of Central Pennsylvania History Project

- <strong>Megan Massanelli</strong>, engagement and outreach librarian, Pitt Library System

- <strong>Frank Pizzoli,</strong> writer, the Village Voice
