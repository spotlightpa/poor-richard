<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><em>Spotlight PA</em></a><em> is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. </em><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><em>Sign up for our free newsletters</em></a><em>.</em>

Before the rise of the internet, Pennsylvania’s queer community connected through underground newsletters, newspapers, zines, and hotlines. The media wave started in big cities, like Philadelphia, but soon spread to much smaller communities statewide.

That movement, the players, and the accompanying risks are the topic of our next event, one focused on the history of LGBTQ\+ media in Pennsylvania and an upcoming retrospective hosted by the LGBT Center of Central Pennsylvania History Project.

Join us Thursday, June 13 from 6-7 p.m. ET on Zoom for a free discussion with a panel of experts on Pennsylvania’s queer media landscape —&nbsp;past, present, and future.

<strong>Our panelists include:</strong>

- <strong>Colin Deppen</strong>, newsletter editor, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Barry Loveland</strong>, chair, LGBT Center of Central Pennsylvania History Project

- <strong>Megan Massanelli</strong>, engagement and outreach librarian, Pitt Library System

- <strong>Frank Pizzoli,</strong> former editor and publisher, the Central Voice
