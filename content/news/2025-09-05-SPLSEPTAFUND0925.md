HARRISBURG — SEPTA has asked the Shapiro administration to tap hundreds of millions of dollars set aside for critical repairs and maintenance to restore full service and hold off planned fare hikes.

A spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro would not comment beyond saying the administration “is reviewing this request and determining next steps.”

One top Democrat told fellow lawmakers pulling money from the special transit fund is not ideal, but &#34;this move will be done ... in collaboration between the state and transit agencies.&#34;

The fund transfer would not require approval from state Senate Republicans. It also comes shortly after a court <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/09/septa-philadelphia-cuts-service-restored-court-order-capitol/">ruling</a> that will force SEPTA to reverse major service cuts and halt a planned fare increase.

On Friday, Scott Sauer, general manager of Philadelphia’s SEPTA, sent a letter to Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Secretary Michael Carroll, in which he asked for approval to use up to $394 million in capital assistance funds for daily operations.

This, he wrote, would allow SEPTA to restore service and avoid planned service cuts and reductions for the next two years.

“It was our hope that the Legislature could come to an agreement and pass into law Governor Shapiro’s plan to increase recurring revenue and fund a long-term solution for SEPTA,” Sauer wrote in the letter obtained by Spotlight PA. “We are thankful to the Governor and the entire Shapiro Administration for staying at the table and fighting for SEPTA&#39;s riders and employees; however, given the legislative delay and increasing fiscal pressures, we are faced with no other option than to request this waiver.”

An email sent by state Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) to his fellow chamber Democrats on Friday, which was also obtained by Spotlight PA, shed more light on the request.

He framed it as “the governor, PennDOT, SEPTA, and \[Pittsburgh’s transit system\] PRT” having “one more tool they can use to get through the next fiscal year and restore services.”

Costa also said he and state House Democratic leaders are aligned.

“We have been in constant consultation with them on how to proceed and we believe based on several factors we must pivot,” he said of the decision to embrace a funding approach that had, until now, been mostly championed by Republicans.

For weeks, the Republicans who control Pennsylvania’s state Senate have endorsed a plan to tap a special transit fund that pays for capital projects, like new trolleys and trains, to help fund agencies’ operations as well as road and bridge work. They have called SEPTA’s financial complaints — and the steep service cuts the agency has enacted —&nbsp;a “manufactured crisis.”

Democrats had resisted the plan, saying that SEPTA and other transit agencies need new, recurring revenue to be truly stable. Transit agencies around the country have suffered financially after pandemic-induced declines in ridership and the subsequent sunsetting of federal stimulus dollars.

Shapiro and other Democrats also opposed the Republicans’ pitch to use transit money for roads and bridges.

But, Costa wrote in his email to Democrats, “It has unfortunately become clear that the Senate Republicans do not wish to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution.”
