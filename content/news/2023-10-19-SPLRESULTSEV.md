Pennsylvania voters will soon begin turning in mail ballots and prepping to head to the polls on Nov. 7 to elect new judges to sit on multiple statewide courts. These judges will make decisions that influence major issues such as election administration, abortion law, and redistricting, as well as weigh in on smaller-scale cases involving child custody, probation, and business disputes

To understand how these elected officials will impact the state, Spotlight PA is holding a free panel after the election results come in.

Join us, the New Pennsylvania Project and Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts on Thursday, Nov. 16 from 6-7 p.m. ET for a Q&amp;A on the election results and what they mean for the future of the state.

<strong>Our panelists include:</strong>

- <strong>Katie Meyer</strong>, government editor and reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Kadida Kenner,</strong> founding chief executive officer, New Pennsylvania Project

- <strong>Deborah Gross,</strong> president &amp; CEO, Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts
