Pennsylvania voters went to the polls on Nov. 7 to elect new judges to sit on multiple statewide courts. These judges will make decisions that influence major issues such as election administration, abortion law, and redistricting, as well as weigh in on smaller-scale cases involving child custody, probation, and business disputes

To understand how these elected officials will impact the state, Spotlight PA held a free panel on the results.

Spotlight PA was joined by the New Pennsylvania Project and Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts.

<strong>Our panelists included:</strong>

- <strong>Katie Meyer</strong>, government editor and reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Kadida Kenner,</strong> founding chief executive officer, New Pennsylvania Project

- <strong>Deborah Gross,</strong> president and CEO, Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts
