HARRISBURG — Election Day 2023 in Pennsylvania is quickly approaching. If you still have questions about where your polling place is, who is on the ballot, and how to vote, Spotlight PA has got you covered.

On Tuesday, Nov. 7, voters across the commonwealth will select a new state Supreme Court justice and new judges to sit on Commonwealth and Superior Courts. They will also determine whether two judges on Superior Court will get another term.

In various parts of the state, Pennsylvanians will also vote in municipal elections, for offices like mayor, and school board.

Before you submit your ballot, here’s a last-minute checklist of everything you’ll need in order to vote.

First, the basics:

- Make sure you’re registered. You can check your voter registration status <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">on the Department of State website</a>. Unfortunately, if you’re not already registered, it’s too late to vote in this election cycle.

- It also is too late to request a mail ballot if you haven’t already. If you have, you can track your mail ballot on the <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx">Department of State&#39;s Election Ballot Status website</a>. In order to be counted, your ballot must be received by your county election office by 8 p.m. on Election Day. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/10/pennsylvania-election-2023-mail-ballot-how-to-request-fill-out-return/">Read more about mail ballots and how to properly fill them out</a>.

- If you plan to vote in-person, you can find your polling place <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">online</a>.

- You need to bring a form of ID such as a driver’s license or a passport if it’s your first time voting at your polling location. You can find the full list of acceptable IDs <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-ID-for-First-Time-Voters.aspx">on Pennsylvania&#39;s official election website</a>.
