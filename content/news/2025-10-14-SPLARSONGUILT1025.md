HARRISBURG — Hours after a Harrisburg man pleaded guilty to attempting to murder Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro in a brazen arson attack earlier this year, the Democrat said he and his family are still struggling with the emotional aftermath but will not be deterred from public service.

At a news conference in the state Capitol on Tuesday, Shapiro, together with his wife Lori, told reporters that he still replays the haunting steps the attacker, Harrisburg resident Cody Balmer, took in the early morning hours of April 13.

That is when Balmer scaled the perimeter fence at the governor’s residence in Harrisburg, walked unimpeded up to the stately mansion, broke windows, and used homemade Molotov cocktails to set fire to several rooms inside while Shapiro and his family were asleep. Balmer has told law enforcement authorities that had he encountered the governor that night, he would have hit him with a hammer he had brought with him.

“Now, when we walk through the residence, we often think about the steps he took and where he roamed,” Shapiro said Tuesday. “Those doors that he tried to break through, that metal hammer that he wielded that apparently he wanted to use to kill me.”

Those steps were captured in a series of chilling videos released by prosecutors on Tuesday. They show Balmer determinedly entering the mansion after entering through a window he broke, and roaming through several rooms unsuccessfully trying to kick down doors, before walking out.

“Our kids will ask, how were they able to get so far into the governor’s residence, the place that was supposed to be the safest place we could possibly be,” Shapiro said.

Balmer pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, and other offenses. He will serve at least 25 years in prison.

The governor said he and his family “fully supported” Balmer’s plea deal, calling it “a just outcome.”

Shapiro also took the opportunity to once again decry political violence and urge people not to normalize it.

“I think it’s important that in this time of rising political violence, that none of us grow numb to it or accept this as the normal course of doing business for elected officials,” he said, adding that he’s heard from many leaders in Pennsylvania and beyond about their worry over the risks of public service.

He said he has leaned on his faith to work through those same concerns, and remains committed to “doing our work on behalf of Pennsylvania.”

“And,” he said, “nothing and no one will stop us from doing that important work.”
