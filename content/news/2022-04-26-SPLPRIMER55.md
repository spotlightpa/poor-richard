This fall, voters will head to the ballot box to pick Pennsylvania’s next governor. The winner will shape the state’s policies, economy, and priorities for at least four years.

Long before that date, Democrats and Republicans will vote during the May 17 primary to decide which candidates make it onto the November ballot.

The 10 candidates for governor each have their own ideas about how to reshape election policy, approach environmental issues, and invest in education, among other issues. To help inform you about the candidates and their platforms, on Thursday, May 5, Spotlight PA held a panel on who is running, how they plan to lead Pennsylvania, and how to spot election misinformation. 

The discussion, a roundup of our election coverage, and tools for vetting election misinformation are below.

Our panelists were:

- <b>Stephen Caruso</b>, legislative reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Ethan Edward Coston</b>, government reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Sam Chen</b>, host of <i>Face the Issues</i> and political scientist and analyst
