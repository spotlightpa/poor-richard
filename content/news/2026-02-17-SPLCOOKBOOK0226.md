“Shut Up and Read” is not just a saying for Jeannine Cook. It’s an affirmation, a prayer, and the title of her new memoir. <em>Shut Up and Read</em> follows Cook’s life from being raised by a blind librarian, to fleeing abuse and creating the iconic Harriett’s Bookshop in Philadelphia. Cook writes about how she found her purpose, community, and survived the COVID-19 pandemic when many shops could not.

Join Booklight PA in reading the memoir then discuss it with Cook on <strong>Thursday, March 26 at 6 p.m. via Zoom.</strong> <strong></strong>
