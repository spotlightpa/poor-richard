HARRISBURG — This year, all Pennsylvania House representatives and half of state senators will be on the ballot.

These races receive less media attention than top-of-the-ballot ones, such as those for president and U.S. Senate. That’s why Spotlight PA has compiled this guide to help you evaluate which candidates you want to send to or keep in Harrisburg.

{{<embed/newsletter>}}

Those positions come with a six-digit base salary, perks such as per diems, and the ability to hire a full-time staff. In return, legislators are expected to act as a front door to state government. They also work with their elected colleagues to solve problems and represent their constituents&#39; interests.

Keep reading to learn more about how to vet both incumbent lawmakers as well as candidates hoping to win office:

<h2 id="spl-heading-1">How to vet incumbent legislative candidates</h2>

Use <a href="https://web.archive.org/20110212132149/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/index.cfm">this tool</a> to find out who your legislators are. Reminder: All state representatives will stand for election this year, while only state senators in odd-numbered districts will be on the ballot.

Each <a href="https://web.archive.org/20120509103731/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/mbrList.cfm?body=H&amp;sort=alpha">state House</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/20120511193734/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/mbrList.cfm?body=S&amp;sort=alpha">state Senate</a> lawmaker has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/19990125104802/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/">web page</a> that lists every legislative memo they’ve circulated (under “co-sponsorship memoranda”) and bill they’ve signed on to this session (under “sponsored legislation”).

Alex Garlick, a University of Vermont professor who studies American legislatures, previously told Spotlight PA that you can understand a lawmaker’s priorities by looking at the legislation they back.

There are a few other ways to evaluate lawmakers, though all have pros and cons, Garlick said.

For instance, you could count how many bills introduced by a lawmaker became law. But that method alone isn’t sufficient, Garlick said, “because a lot of bills fail along the way.”

Bills that move through the Pennsylvania legislature are often rewritten, meaning what becomes law may be completely unrelated to what was introduced. Also, sometimes a lawmaker&#39;s bill gets absorbed into a larger measure.

Most rank-and-file lawmakers — especially those in the minority party — don’t have the power to ensure their bills are considered. That ability belongs to committee chairs and members of the majority leadership team, who make these decisions based on their own priorities.

How a lawmaker votes on bills, however, can be informative. Do they buck party lines? Do they abstain from politically tricky measures? Do they prioritize unity?

Both chambers have advanced some weighty proposals over the past year. You can see how your lawmakers voted by clicking the below links.

You can also understand a legislator&#39;s values by looking at the organizations that support them. As of early September, the following notable organizations have endorsed candidates in some races:

- <a href="https://www.conservationpa.org/endorsements/2024-endorsements">Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania</a>, a statewide environmental advocacy organization

- The <a href="https://web.archive.org/20231207101255/https://paaflcio.com/endorsed-candidates/">Pennsylvania AFL-CIO</a>, a federation of 51 public and private sector unions representing 700,000 workers.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240415184843/https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-pennsylvania-advocates/elections/pp-pa-pac-2024-endorsements">Planned Parenthood PA</a>, a statewide advocate for reproductive and sexual health care providers, including abortion services.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240814232421/https://www.seiupa.org/news/2024/07/23/seiu-pa-state-council-announces-endorsed-candidates-for-the-2024-general-election/">Service Employees International Union</a>, which represents workers in fields including health care, janitorial and property services, and state and county social services.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20200919055456/https://www.ufcw1776.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=832068&amp;page=Political20Action">United Food and Commercial Workers 1776</a>, a union that represents workers at grocery stores, state liquor stores, medical marijuana facilities, food manufacturing plants, and other places.

Other groups do not endorse candidates, instead recommending or not recommending a candidate based on their position on a particular issue:

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20140812183041/https://foac-pac.org/Voter-Guide">Firearms Owners Against Crime</a>, an influential Pennsylvania-based gun rights group.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20170603210411/https://schoolhouseballot.com/">Pennsylvania State Education Association</a>, the state’s largest teachers union.

Other organizations issue “report cards” that grade lawmakers on their votes. These report cards inherently reflect the organization and its values; groups in the same advocacy space, such as gun rights, may issue different grades to the same lawmaker. Some report cards note which votes the organizations considered:

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20210203173404/https://aclupalegislativescorecard.org/#/">The ACLU</a>, a civil rights group that advocates for structural changes to the criminal justice system, free speech, and the right to privacy.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20160407052722/https://pataxpayerscorecard.com/#/">Americans for Prosperity</a>, a libertarian free market and limited government advocacy group with ties to the Koch family.

- <a href="https://www.ceasefirepa.org/resources/legislative-scoreards/#/">CeasefirePA</a>, an anti-violence group that advocates for stricter gun laws

- The right-wing <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240414182451/https://www.cpac.org/us/ratings">Conservative Political Action Conference</a>, or CPAC, which has become increasingly associated with former President Donald Trump.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20201020194605/https://pennsylvania.gunowners.org/grades/">Gun Owners of America</a>, a growing gun rights group that has criticized the NRA for being “too liberal.”

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20140812195248/https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/Pennsylvania">The National Rifle Association</a>, an established gun rights group.

- <a href="https://web.archive.org/20220518171403/https://www.pachamber.org/advocacy/chamber_pac/legislative_scorecard/">The PA Chamber of Business and Industry</a>, a pro-business advocacy group that supports lower taxes and fewer regulations.

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">How to vet legislative candidates who aren’t incumbents</h2>

For legislative candidates who aren’t incumbents, the best way to start your research is through the search engine of your choice.

A candidate’s official campaign website or Facebook page often includes a bio, information about their priorities, and noteworthy endorsements from politicians and organizations.

The organizations referenced above may endorse candidates who aren’t incumbents based on internal interviews or questionnaires.

Other groups, such as the conservative <a href="https://web.archive.org/20100501170213/https://www.pafamilyvoter.com/">Pennsylvania Family Institute</a>, skip endorsements or grades, and instead publish surveys in which candidates, both incumbents and nonincumbents, are asked questions about their priorities.

The nonpartisan League of Women Voters Education Fund also publishes <a href="https://web.archive.org/20210103172720/https://www.vote411.org/ballot">questionnaires</a> for all legislative candidates.

Local chapters of that organization — as well as news outlets, business groups, and local political committees — may host candidate forums or debates. These events allow you to see candidates interact in real time and may allow you to meet them in person.

Checking campaign finance records <a href="https://web.archive.org/20170128182100/https://www.campaignfinanceonline.pa.gov/Pages/CFReportSearch.aspx">online</a> through the Pennsylvania Department of State allows you to see which people and groups fund a candidate. It’s best to search by last name.

Donations are divided by size on the report, and by whether the money came from an individual or a political action committee associated with a corporation, union, or other interest group.

Legislators have already filed <a href="https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/programs/voting-and-elections/campaign-finance.html">at least two</a> campaign finance reports; they won’t have to file a report showing how much they’ve raised over the summer and fall until Oct. 25.

You also can look at candidates’ statements of financial interest, which show their sources of income, creditors, property, and gifts among other information. The state Ethics Commission holds onto them; you can search for one <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240520060308/https://www.ethicsrulings.pa.gov/WebLink/CustomSearch.aspx?SearchName=SearchforStatementofFinancialInterestsForms&amp;dbid=0&amp;repo=Ethics">here</a>.
