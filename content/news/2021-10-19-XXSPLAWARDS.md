Spotlight PA — a nonpartisan, reader-funded newsroom dedicated to covering Pennsylvania state government and urgent statewide issues — has been awarded two national investigative journalism prizes for its work on the Mariner East pipeline system and the state’s poor oversight of addiction treatment facilities.

“At Risk, In the Dark,” an investigation into <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/mariner-east-pipeline/" target="_blank">how secrecy and a patchwork of emergency plans around the pipelines have left many communities in the dark</a> about what to do in case of an accident, was awarded the Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award by the Online News Association.

“Fundamental Flaws,” an investigation into <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/fundamental-flaws/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania’s flawed oversight of addiction treatment facilities</a> produced in partnership with KHN, was honored with the Best Investigative Journalism Prize by the Institute for Nonprofit News, which recognizes excellence by independent and nonprofit newsrooms.
