Violence, racial hatred, and a chance for freedom motivated millions of Black Americans to move from the south to the north. Author and playwright Lorene Cary sheds light on the largely untold history of Black land ownership, migration, and race through the eyes of the Needham family.

After the violent death of their patriarch, King, members of the Needham family migrate from South Carolina to the north. But, when his grieving widow stays behind to raise their children, the responsibility to bring their family together ultimately falls on King’s great-grandson, Rayne.

The New York Times Book Review calls <em>If Sons, Then Heirs</em> “Engaging… Bluesy and emotionally resonant.” The Philadelphia Inquirer called the novel a &#34;multilayered, complex, and engaging tale of love, social injustice, and migrations– both physical and emotional.”

As part of Spotlight PA’s new book club, Booklight PA, we’re reading Cary’s deeply moving portrait of family legacy and discussing it with readers across the state on Discord.
