HARRISBURG — No matter where you live in Pennsylvania, you will be asked to vote for the person you want to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Pennsylvania has 17 congressional districts, five of which are considered <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings">competitive</a> by the Cook Political Report. The commonwealth lost a congressional seat during the 2020 redistricting process because its population grew less than other states. <strong></strong>

Below, we explain who is running in each district and the key issues in the competitive races. Not sure which district you live in? Use this <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative">tool</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-1">District 1*</h2>

Pennsylvania’s 1st Congressional District includes all of Bucks County and part of Montgomery County. Voters in this district have lately voted for Democratic presidential candidates. That makes the 1st District a perennial target for Democrats, but U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who is one of the more moderate Republicans in Congress, has proved difficult to unseat. The Cook Political Report says this race is one of five in Pennsylvania that is competitive; it is “<a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings">likely Republican</a>.”

<strong>Democrat: </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/20211012113240/https://www.ehaszforcongress.com/">Ashley Ehasz</a>

A resident of Bensalem who grew up in southeast Pennsylvania, Ehasz is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the University of Oxford. She is an Army combat veteran who was an Apache helicopter pilot. Currently, she is a government and public service sector consultant.

<strong>Key issues: </strong>This race has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/bucks-county-congressional-election-abortion-20240627.html">focused on abortion</a>. Fitzpatrick <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/house-vote-abortion-after-20-week-ban/index.html">voted</a> in <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017549">favor</a> of a 20-week ban in 2017, and <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/challengers-ehasz-and-stelson-keep-abortion-policy-front-and-center-in-u-s-house-campaigns/">against</a> bills to codify the right to abortion.

<h2 id="spl-heading-10">District 10*</h2>

Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District includes all of Dauphin County and portions of Cumberland and York Counties.
