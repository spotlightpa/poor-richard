HARRISBURG — Where you live in Pennsylvania determines many of the options you have to cast a ballot and ensure it was counted, resulting in vastly unequal access.

As part of a first-of-its-kind review, Spotlight PA and Votebeat contacted election officials in all 67 counties about policies regarding drop boxes and mail ballots that had disqualifying technical errors. The news organizations also sought to understand the access voters have to physical polling places and to minutes of meetings held by county election boards that make critical policy decisions.

Use this interactive scorecard from Spotlight PA and Votebeat to find out how your Pennsylvania county ranks on voter friendliness.
