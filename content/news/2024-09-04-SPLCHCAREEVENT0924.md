Two things plague <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/05/pennsylvania-child-care-staffing-shortage-pay-cost-crisis/">Pennsylvania’s child care industry</a>: many families find care unaffordable and inaccessible while workers are given low pay and often do not remain in their jobs for long. Business groups have urged lawmakers to take action, saying the staffing shortage affects “virtually all economic sectors.”

Child care providers and advocates say the typical legislative response of tax credits for families and<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/pennsylvania-child-care-subsidy-cost-tuition-rhode-island/"> intermittent boosts of state money towards child care programs</a> fail to address structural issues with the industry.

Spotlight PA held a free panel discussion on Pennsylvania’s child care staffing shortage, and the solutions proposed by lawmakers and advocates.

<strong>Our panelists included:</strong>

- <strong>Ed Mahon</strong>, investigative reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Jen DeBell</strong>, executive director, Pennsylvania Association for the Education of Young Children

- <strong>Gina Cappel,</strong> director, Jerusalem Child Care and Learning Center in Schuylkill County

- <strong>Judy Schwank, </strong>state senator, Berks County
