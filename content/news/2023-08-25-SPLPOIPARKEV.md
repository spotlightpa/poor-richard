Pennsylvania’s Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976 was designed to protect people experiencing mental health issues from prosecution if they cannot understand the legal system and cannot aid in their own defense.

<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/a-criminal-solution/">A six-month investigation</a> by Spotlight PA and the Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism found that the law often traps these people in jails — which can worsen their mental health — and that it has little oversight and is applied inconsistently.

On Thursday, Sept. 14, join Spotlight PA at Point Park University’s Center for Media Innovation for a live discussion of mental health in Pennsylvania jails and how the newsrooms reported one woman’s fight for freedom.
