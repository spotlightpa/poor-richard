On April 23, Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans will decide their parties’ nominees for attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer. These three statewide positions, known as row offices, hold considerable power over the state’s finances, laws, and oversight mechanisms.

The winners will receive their party’s nomination and face off in the Nov. 5 general election.

To help you cast an informed vote, Spotlight PA’s Capitol reporter Stephen Caruso hosted an event on the candidates’ backgrounds and their plans for the offices. Watch it below.
