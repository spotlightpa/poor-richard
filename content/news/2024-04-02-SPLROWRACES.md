<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><em>Spotlight PA</em></a><em> is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. </em><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><em>Sign up for our free newsletters</em></a><em>.</em>

On April 23, Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans will decide their parties’ nominees for attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer. These three statewide positions, known as row offices, hold considerable power over the state’s finances, laws, and oversight mechanisms.

The winners will receive their party’s nomination and face off in the Nov. 5 general election.

To help you cast an informed vote, Spotlight PA’s Capitol reporter Stephen Caruso is hosting a panel on the candidates’ backgrounds and their plans for the offices.

On Thursday, April 11 from 6-7 p.m. ET, join us on Zoom for a live guide to Pennsylvania’s row office candidates, and how their terms would impact you.
