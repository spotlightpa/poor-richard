Itâ€™s no secret that Pennsylvaniaâ€™s history is full of notable inventions, contributions to pop culture, and events with national and international significance. But how well do you know them?

In this quiz, weâ€™ll name 20 real-life historical events â€” from the birth of a founding father to the creation of one of the commonwealthâ€™s favorite sweet treats â€” and you simply hit a button to indicate whether you think it happened in the Keystone State, or elsewhere.

It takes about three to five minutes to complete, and youâ€™ll learn a lot â€” or youâ€™ll come away feeling really good about yourself for being a Pennsylvania trivia wiz ðŸŒŸ
