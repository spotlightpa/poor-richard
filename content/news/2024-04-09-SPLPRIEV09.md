In the final days before the Pennsylvania primary, join Spotlight PA on Friday, April 19 at 6 p.m. ET for a live one-on-one interview with <strong>Nick Troiano</strong>, author of <em>The Primary Solution, </em>a new book on how partisan primaries are fueling the nation’s divide and what can be done about it.
