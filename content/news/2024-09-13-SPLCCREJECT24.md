HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s highest court has vacated a ruling that would have prevented counties from rejecting mail ballots solely because the return envelopes were not properly dated.

The state Supreme Court ruling released Friday does not weigh in on the merits of the case or on Commonwealth Court’s August decision. The lower court had found not counting a voter&#39;s mail ballot because it was undated or incorrectly dated <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/08/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-date-dating-commonwealth-court-ruling-republican-appeal/">violates their rights under the state constitution</a>.

Rather, the high court rejected the lower court ruling on a technicality. The decision could affect thousands of mail ballot voters this November.

“The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties, and because the joinder of Al Schmidt, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Commonwealth, did not suffice to invoke the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction,” the court wrote in its order.
