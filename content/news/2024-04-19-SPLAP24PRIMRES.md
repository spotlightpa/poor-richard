<h2 id="spl-heading-1">Pennsylvania election results</h2>

On April 23, Democratic and Republican voters <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/04/pennsylvania-primary-election-day-2024-voter-information-registration/">cast their ballots in the primary election</a>. They will determine which candidates will go on to run in the general election for president, Congress (U.S. House and Senate), row offices (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and the Pennsylvania legislature.

To ensure we are reporting the most accurate results and to avoid contributing to confusion, Spotlight PA will not report on projected winners or publish results stories until the Associated Press calls the race. For many reasons, the AP may not make all calls on the night of the election.

For voters interested in seeing rolling tallies, Spotlight PA is making available for free a tool that displays Associated Press results. Those results will be displayed under each office noted below. Please check back as results will be updated regularly.<em></em>

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">U.S. president</h2>

In 2020, Pennsylvania was one of the decisive states in President Joe Biden’s victory after a highly contentious presidential election during the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Donald Trump denied the loss, baselessly claimed fraud, and ultimately encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol while votes were being certified, in what culminated in the Jan. 6 <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/january-6-capitol-riot-pennsylvania-role/">riot and insurrection</a>.

Biden has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240312233542/https://apnews.com/article/biden-presumptive-nominee-election-president-democrat-63b66006d4bc45354343228e323e3baa">won enough delegates</a> in the primary to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, though U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota will appear on the primary ballot in Pennsylvania despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240307070654/https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/dean-phillips-drops-out-00145403">suspending</a> his campaign in early March.

Trump has <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240306175637/https://apnews.com/article/trump-haley-election-2024-republicans-9736f3b504eef4da5a8ef7f8bbae9dfc">secured the nomination</a> for the Republican Party; despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240306112716/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nikki-haley-ends-presidential-campaign-trump-gop-primary-rcna134811">dropping out of the race</a>, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will appear on the ballot here.

<h2 id="spl-heading-10">Frequently asked questions</h2>

{{<embed/donate>}}

<h3 id="spl-heading-11">Q: When will we know the final results of the primary election?</h3>

A: Votes will be counted throughout the evening on April 23 after polls close at 8 p.m. and released in batches for several hours. By state law, Pennsylvania counties cannot process mail ballots before Election Day, and many have different procedures for counting votes and in what order.

Still, election experts expect unofficial results for most races <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/04/pennsylvania-primary-election-results-2024-when-to-expect/">will be available on election night</a>.

<h3 id="spl-heading-12">Q: How can I find the latest election results in Pennsylvania?</h3>

A: For statewide races and races for the General Assembly, you can check the Department of State’s election results website <a href="https://web.archive.org/20200220053315/https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/">here</a>.

<h3 id="spl-heading-13">Q: Can I track my mail-in ballot in Pennsylvania?</h3>

A: Yes, the Pennsylvania Department of State allows you to track your ballot on its website. Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/20240108142928/https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx">pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx</a>, where you will see a prompt to enter your name, date of birth, and county of residence. You can also contact your county election office to confirm the status of your ballot.

<h3 id="spl-heading-14">Q: What happens if there is a recount?</h3>

In Pennsylvania, a recount is automatically triggered when the margin is .5% or less. Election officials must then carry out the recount.

Three or more voters in a voting precinct can also request a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/12/pa-midterm-election-2022-recount-petitions-certification-history/">recount</a>. Candidates cannot request a recount.

A recount must be completed within three weeks of the election.

Learn more <a href="https://web.archive.org/20201106225300/https://www.inquirer.com/news/recount-election-pennsylvania-rules-law-20201106.html">about recounts from The Inquirer</a>.

<h3 id="spl-heading-15">Q: How does the media get election results?</h3>

A: The Pennsylvania Department of State makes election results available to the media.

<h3 id="spl-heading-16">Q: What is the process for certifying election results in Pennsylvania?</h3>

A: According to reporting by Votebeat, the process begins when the polls close and “counties begin uploading in-person results to their websites and that of the Department of State.”

A few days later, counties will begin their official canvass of the election.

“The canvass is just going through and double-, triple-checking that you have all of the ballots accounted for,” said Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Iowa who specializes in elections law, in 2022. Election officials are “making sure that everything is included and that every lawfully cast ballot is included in that final tally.”

“County elections offices will process provisional ballots during this time, checking to make sure the voters who cast them had not already submitted a mail-in ballot or whether the provisional ballots were somehow otherwise ineligible,” Votebeat reported. “Counties will also ‘reconcile’ their votes, meaning they will check to ensure that the number of voters recorded as having cast ballots in a given precinct matches the number of ballots counted from that precinct.”

“County elections offices also perform post-election audits during this period. Counties are required to do a recount of a random sample of 2% of ballots cast or 2,000 ballots, whichever is fewer. Many counties also began conducting risk-limiting audits after the 2020 election, in which a random sample of ballots are hand-counted to ensure the totals match the results from the tabulation machine.”

By the Tuesday after Election Day, counties must submit results — as up-to-date as possible, but still unofficial — to the Department of State. These figures could change slightly as military and overseas ballots are counted and included in the tallies, per Votebeat.

“Local boards of election, comprised of the county’s commissioners, must sign a copy of the results twice for an election to be certified. Typically, candidates raise any challenges to the canvassing process in the five-day window between the first and second signings.”
