Officers in Pennsylvania have killed or used force on 108 civilians since 2017, according to a Spotlight PA examination of databases maintained by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://fatalencounters.org/">Fatal Encounters</a>. Elected district attorneys almost always decide whether to charge these officers, and their choices often receive little pushback.

Expanded access to videos of police using lethal force has increased public awareness of the problem, but few people know how and why courts rule these cases justified.

On Thursday, Dec. 16. at 7 p.m. EST, Spotlight PA held a free discussion on why killings by police officers often are ruled justified and the investigation process that leads to such rulings.

Our panelists were:

- <b>Gary Harki</b>, criminal justice reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Stephanie Morales</b>, Commonwealth’s Attorney of Portsmouth, Virginia

- <b>Tierra D. Williams</b>, chair of the 3/20 Coalition

- <b>David Harris</b>, Sally Ann Semenko Endowed Chair and Professor of Law at University of Pittsburgh
