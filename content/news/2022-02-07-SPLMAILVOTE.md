Act 77, Pennsylvania’s mail voting law, was <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/pa-mail-voting-court-ruling-unconstitutional-whats-next/">ruled unconstitutional</a> by a state court in January after a group of Republican lawmakers — many of whom voted for it — brought a challenge. In a 3-2 decision, Commonwealth Court ruled that allowing voting by mail without an excuse would require an amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, an extensive process that would culminate with the matter being sent to the ballot and decided by voters.

The law remains in place as the Wolf administration pursues an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has agreed to hear arguments next month. Though Democrats dominate the state’s highest court, some experts say the case will be a “close legal question.”

On Feb. 17, a panel organized by Spotlight PA discussed Act 77, why it’s being challenged, and what to expect from the high court. Watch it below.

Our panelists included:

- <b>Angela Couloumbis</b>, investigative reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Omar Sabir</b>, city commissioner of the County of Philadelphia

- <b>Ray Murphy</b>, deputy director of Pennsylvania Voice

- <b>Dan Moul</b>, Republican state representative, 91st District
