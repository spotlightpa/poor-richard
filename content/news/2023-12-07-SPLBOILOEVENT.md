As temperatures drop, Pennsylvania coal country is putting pots of boilo on the stove. Sweet, tangy, and strong, the alcoholic drink (and some say cold remedy) is a wintertime staple and the Americanized version of a popular Eastern European beverage.

But how did <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/palocal/theres-no-wrong-way-to-make-boilo-this-winter/">boilo</a> make its way to the Keystone State?

To learn about the drink’s globe-spanning history and how to make some yourself, Spotlight PA is hosting a free virtual event with boilo expert Paul Domalakes of Schuylkill County, the cradle of Pennsylvania’s boilo boom.

Join us Thursday, Dec. 14 from 6-7 p.m. on Zoom for a free Q&amp;A and demonstration on crafting boilo, and as a bonus, try your hand at some Pennsylvania wintertime trivia in the last half hour for a chance to win Spotlight PA swag.<strong></strong>
