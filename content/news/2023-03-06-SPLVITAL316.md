Open records battles are all too familiar for journalists covering health care in Pennsylvania. In addition to conducting countless interviews, reporters often wrestle with department officials over Right-to-Know requests.

To understand your open records rights and how members of the media tackle transparency on this issue, or the lack thereof, Spotlight PA held a free panel on the subject.

Spotlight PA’s Ed Mahon was there to share his hard-earned tips from a lengthy legal fight for medical marijuana records the Wolf administration sought to keep private.

In 2021, the Pennsylvania Department of Health took Spotlight PA to court in an effort to keep hidden information on how often cannabis is approved to treat opioid use disorder in Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program, an approach with little scientific backing.

A panel of Commonwealth Court judges ultimately ordered the administration to release the records, allowing Mahon to report on how <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/01/pa-medical-marijuana-certification-card-anxiety/">anxiety became the top reason</a> that doctors approve patients for the medical marijuana program.

This event was part of Sunshine Week, a national initiative spearheaded by the News Leaders Association to educate the public about the importance of open government and the dangers of excessive and unnecessary secrecy.

Our panelists included:

- <b>Ed Mahon</b>, investigative reporter covering human services, Spotlight PA

- <b>Brett Sholtis</b>, investigative reporter, LancasterOnline (LNP)

- <b>Terry Mutchler</b>, former head of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records
