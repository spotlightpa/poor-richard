<em>This callout first appeared in PA Local, a weekly newsletter by Spotlight PA taking a fresh, positive look at the incredible people, beautiful places, and delicious food of Pennsylvania. </em><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><em>Sign up for free here.</em></a><em></em>

Warmer weather is coming to Pennsylvania, and we&#39;re looking for the best ways to spend the next stretch of 2025. That&#39;s where you come in.

Inspired by the folks at <a href="https://spotlightpa.bluelena.io/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE6InKcEpR7zN26hRKgAXMgut9wjug0YnnGJnSb65V--Uy.zudy142nk_Y~jNYxYXbJKk">Bridge Michigan</a>, we&#39;re asking readers like you to help us make a summer bucket list full of places (new and old) worth trekking to.

We&#39;re looking for lesser-known gems and places a bit off the beaten path, and in a big state full of natural beauty and world-class cities, that well runs deep. Think <a href="https://spotlightpa.bluelena.io/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE6InKcEpR7zN26hRKgAXMgut9wjug0YnnGJnSb65V--Uy.zudy142nk_Y~jNYxYXbJI0">secret beaches</a>, <a href="https://spotlightpa.bluelena.io/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE6InKcEpR7zN26hRKgAXMgut9wjug0YnnGJnSb65V--Uy.zudy142nk_Y~jNYxYXbJIC">remote campsites</a>, <a href="https://spotlightpa.bluelena.io/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE6InKcEpR7zN26hRKgAXMgut9wjug0YnnGJnSb65V--Uy.zudy142nk_Y~jNYxYXbJJU">quirky festivals</a>, and more.

The parameters are simple: It must be in Pennsylvania, doable in summer, and ideally more than just a photo op.

If we get enough submissions, we&#39;ll put a list together, share it with you, and see who can finish it by the end of the season (photos will be required). Then we’ll crown a group of winners who will receive lifetime bragging rights and shipments of Spotlight PA merch.

So, what are we getting up to this summer? <a href="https://spotlightpa.bluelena.io/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE6InKcEpR7zN26hRKgAXMgut9wjug0YnnGJnSb65V--Uy.zudy142nk_Y~jNYxYXbKIU">Tell us here</a>.
