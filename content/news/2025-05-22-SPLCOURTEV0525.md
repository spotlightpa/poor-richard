Federal judges have been thrust into the center of our nation’s politics as courts across the country are flooded with challenges to changes by President Donald Trump’s administration, and as some Republicans have advocated for defying rulings, or impeachment.

At the same time, the attention has sparked debate over whether federal judges should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions over executive branch policies.

And yet, most people don’t fully understand how our federal court system works, the nuances of how it’s run, and why its independence is in everyone’s interest.

Join Spotlight PA on Tuesday, June 3, at 6 p.m. for a live one-on-one interview with Mary France, a retired federal bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania and former Assistant U.S. Trustee. She’ll talk about how the federal courts work and answer your questions about the system.
