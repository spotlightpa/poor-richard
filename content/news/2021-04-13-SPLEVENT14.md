With the continued decline in local news across Pennsylvania, partisan groups are taking advantage by launching efforts that mimic traditional news operations but have undisclosed or disguised political agendas.

Those efforts — as well as others intended to mislead, confuse or trick people, as we saw in last year’s election — spread more quickly than ever across social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

On Tuesday, April 20 at 5 p.m., Spotlight PA’s Editor in Chief <b>Christopher Baxter</b> was in conversation with journalists and information experts about the negative effects of misinformation, how to detect it, and how to fight back against it. Other panelists included:

- <b>Jim Friedlich</b>, executive director and CEO of The Lenfest Institute, the nonprofit owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer

- <b>Anthony Orozco</b>, Latino communities reporter for WITF Public Media

- <b>Dr. Kathleen M. Carley</b>, director of the Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity at Carnegie Mellon University
