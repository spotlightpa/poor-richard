<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, non-partisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

With the continued decline in local news across Pennsylvania, partisan groups are taking advantage by launching efforts that mimic traditional news operations but have undisclosed or disguised political agendas.

Those efforts — as well as others intended to mislead, confuse or trick people, as we saw in last year’s election — spread more quickly than ever across social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

On Tuesday, April 20 at 5 p.m., join Spotlight PA’s Editor in Chief <b>Christopher Baxter</b> in conversation with journalists and information experts about <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/misinformation" target=_blank>the negative effects of misinformation, how to detect it, and how to fight back against it</a>. You can <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/misinformation" target=_blank>RSVP for FREE by clicking here</a>.

And they’ll be taking your questions, too. Other panelists will include:

- <b>Jim Friedlich</b>, executive director and CEO of The Lenfest Institute, the nonprofit owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer

- <b>Anthony Orozco</b>, Latino communities reporter for WITF Public Media

- <b>Dr. Kathleen M. Carley</b>, director of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity&nbsp;at Carnegie Mellon University

You can <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/misinformation" target=_blank>RSVP for FREE and submit your questions in advance here</a>.
