Herm Suplizio helped make DuBois — located about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh — one of the “<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/richest-little-city/">richest little cities in all of Pennsylvania</a>,” as one of his supporters put it.

But that’s not all the former city manager did, according to state and federal prosecutors. They allege he shrewdly used his power, political connections, and control over local organizations to line his own pockets for over a decade.

Suplizio has pleaded not guilty in the federal case and awaits trial.

As the case unfolds, those in DuBois are left grappling with questions like: How could these alleged crimes go unnoticed for so long, and where does the city go from here?

To unpack these questions and more, Spotlight PA hosted discussion on the corruption case and the weak oversight that allowed the alleged crimes to happen. Watch the panel below.

<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>

- <strong>Angela Couloumbis</strong>, investigative reporter for Spotlight PA

- <strong>Min Xian,</strong> local accountability reporter for Spotlight PA State College

- <strong>Leanne Davis, </strong>executive director, City of Pittsburgh Ethics Hearing Board

- <strong>Rachael Heisler</strong>, Pittsburgh city controller

- <strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Jackson</strong>, council member, City of DuBois
