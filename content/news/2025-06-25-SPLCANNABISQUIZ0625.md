HARRISBURG —&nbsp;Think you know a lot about cannabis in Pennsylvania?

You can test your knowledge of the state’s medical marijuana system with our new interactive quiz — which we’re sharing at a time when cannabis rules are receiving extra scrutiny in the state Capitol.

While lawmakers are debating <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/05/cannabis-legalization-weed-small-business-lobbying-budget-pennsylvania/">recreational legalization</a> for adults, they are also considering significant changes to supervision of the medical program. A bill to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/03/pennsylvania-medical-marijuana-program-doctor-oversight/">increase</a> the Department of Health’s oversight powers for cannabis laboratories and doctors passed out of the state House in March with large bipartisan support. Meanwhile, a key lawmaker in the state Senate has proposed a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edmahon.bsky.social/post/3lrq7tcnfwc2z">new oversight model for the entire program</a>.

In this quiz, you’ll answer questions on a range of medical cannabis topics — from the number of patients currently served by the program to advertising rules — by simply clicking your response.
