HARRISBURG — Spotlight PA is continuing to investigate problems with the state’s unemployment system, and is hoping to hear from the people who have helped the Department of Labor and Industry process more than 5.2 million claims since the pandemic began.

As claimants hit their one-year anniversary and some benefits expire, there is continuing concern about inadequate staffing at the department, and the stress faced by those who have worked there.

If you previously worked for the department or are currently employed there, and you helped in any role to get people financial aid during the pandemic, we want to hear from you. What was the experience like? What problems did you experience? What doesn’t the public know?
