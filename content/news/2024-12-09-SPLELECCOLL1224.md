HARRISBURG — Republican Donald Trump will again become president in January, but first, his electors must meet around the country to cast their votes.

This ceremonial part of the Electoral College comes shortly before Congress counts the electoral votes ahead of the inauguration on Jan. 20.

In 2020, this routine part of the process was thrown into chaos when Pennsylvania Republicans urged Congress to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/pennsylvania-electors-republican-reject-congress-bryan-cutler/">reject electoral votes for Democrat Joe Biden</a> and Trump pressured state lawmakers to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-pennsylvania-speaker-call/2020/12/07/d65fe8c4-38bf-11eb-98c4-25dc9f4987e8_story.html">overturn</a> the results as he falsely claimed mass fraud.

However, such disruptions aren&#39;t expected this year with Trump as the victor.

Here’s a look at Pennsylvania’s electors and their responsibilities:

<h2 id="spl-heading-1">What is the Electoral College?</h2>

The framers of the U.S. Constitution created a system in which 538 people, or electors, serve as representatives for the people’s votes in each state and the District of Columbia. Once people vote, the electors then cast their votes directly for president and vice president.

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">How many electoral votes does Pennsylvania have?</h2>

Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes. Like most states, Pennsylvania awards all of them to the winner of the popular vote.

Trump won 3.5 million votes to Democrat Kamala Harris’ 3.4 million, giving him all of Pennsylvania’s electoral votes. In total, Trump won 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226.

Five electors — Bachenberg, Comfort, Khare, Poprik, and Reilly — drew criticism after <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/pa-cov-full.pdf">submitting their names</a> as electors for Pennsylvania in December 2020 and casting votes for Trump, even though Joe Biden won the state’s popular vote.

But unlike similar groups of alternate or “fake” electors in other swing states in 2020, the Pennsylvania slate <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2023/7/31/23814539/pennsylvania-fake-electors-charges-trump-electoral-certificate/">avoided legal repercussions</a> because of a caveat they included in the certificate documenting their vote.

<h2 id="spl-heading-4">How are electors chosen?</h2>

Under Pennsylvania law, each presidential candidate must pick electors within 30 days of their party’s national convention and submit those names to the secretary of the commonwealth.

The electors are appointed based on whichever candidate gets the most votes.

<h2 id="spl-heading-5">What qualifications must electors have?</h2>

The U.S. Constitution prohibits electors from being members of Congress or holding federal office. The 14th Amendment, adopted after the Civil War, prevents any elected officeholders who have rebelled against the U.S. from serving as electors.

<h2 id="spl-heading-6">When do Trump’s electors meet in Pennsylvania?</h2>

Trump’s electors will meet in Harrisburg on Dec. 17.

<h2 id="spl-heading-7">What happens between now and when electors meet in Harrisburg?</h2>

After secretaries of state <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/12/pennsylvania-election-2024-certification-donald-trump-presidential-winners/">certify the election results</a>, the governors must prepare a certificate of ascertainment for the National Archives and Records Administration (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/electoral-college/2020/ascertainment-pennsylvania.pdf">here’s Pennsylvania’s from 2020</a>) with the names of appointed electors and the number of votes cast for each. Gov. Josh Shapiro must do so by Dec. 11.

“Federal law dictates that challenges to the certificate of ascertainment must be resolved no later than December 16, the day before the Electoral College convenes,” according to a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State.

<h2 id="spl-heading-8">Can appointed electors cast a vote for someone other than Trump in Pennsylvania?</h2>

Pennsylvania law doesn’t say anything about so-called “faithless electors,” or electors who cast a vote for a candidate other than the one who won the state popular vote. There’s no federal or constitutional provision requiring electors to cast a vote for the winning party either.

Over the years, there have been a few instances in other states where electors cast votes for candidates that differed from who voters in their state had selected — there were 10 such faithless electors in 2016, though three had their votes invalidated.

Nearly 40 states and Washington, D.C., have <a href="https://fairvote.org/do-faithless-electors-change-presidential-election-results/">laws on the books</a> requiring electors to vote for their candidate, according to FairVote, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for ranked-choice voting. Pennsylvania is not one of them.
