HARRISBURG — SEPTA has instituted major service cuts and will soon increase fares, saying it could not sustain normal operations without additional financial support from the Pennsylvania government.

That funding is tied up in the commonwealth’s two-month-late budget. Throughout talks, state lawmakers had been <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/pennsylvania-budget-impasse-septa-transit-funding-joe-pittman-state-senate-capitol/">divided along partisan lines</a> about the best source of more money for transit agencies.

Democrats originally wanted to increase the percentage of the commonwealth’s sales and use tax revenue that the agencies get. Republicans want to tap a special transit fund that pays for capital projects, like new trolleys and trains, to help fund agencies’ operations as well as road and bridge work.

The two sides appear to be getting closer to a deal. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro says <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/septa-cuts-josh-shapiro-transit-funding-senate-republican-plan-capitol/">he’s open to the GOP’s plan</a>, as long as transit money isn’t used for roads and bridges. The Democrats who control the state House say they’re on board, too.

Shapiro and other Democrats also want to see any dollars spent this year replenished with a new, consistent funding source for transit. But finding an agreeable revenue deal with Republicans has been complicated.

Shapiro is also <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/governor-josh-shapiro-budget-proposal-compromise-50-billion-senate-republican-transit-capitol/">compromising by cutting his overall spending ask</a>. The Republicans who control the state Senate say there’s still no deal, however.

As the legislative stalemate continues, here’s what to know about SEPTA cuts, the budget impasse, and more.

<h2 id="spl-heading-1">Why did SEPTA cut service?</h2>

SEPTA says it has a <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/fundingcrisis/">$213 million budget deficit</a>, and that without more money from the state government, it must cut service and raise fares.

Use of public transit cratered during the COVID-19 pandemic and has been slow to recover. Federal money helped boost budgets temporarily, but that funding is drying up.

And as WHYY <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/septa-budget-philadelphia-pennsylvania-covid-pandemic/">reports</a>, costs are rising for SEPTA: “Those include paying more for fuel, including electricity to run its vehicles, increased costs for replacement parts and other day-to-day expenses thanks to inflationary price increases.”

<h2 id="spl-heading-2">Which SEPTA bus routes and train lines were cut?</h2>

In the first phase of SEPTA’s belt-tightening, the agency says it has implemented 20% service cuts, which include eliminating 32 bus routes, shortening 16 more, and reducing “a significant number of trips on all metro rail services, including the B2 Sports Express.”

See a list of eliminated bus routes and new bus and metro schedules <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/news/bus-metro-fall-schedules/">here</a>.

On Jan. 1, 2026, SEPTA is planning another 25% service cut, which is slated to include getting rid of five regional rail routes and 18 additional bus routes.

“Regional Rail riders will see significant reductions in trips on all routes, longer commute times, and more crowded conditions on board trains,” SEPTA says.

See the system’s full list of planned cuts and schedule modifications <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/fundingcrisis/">here</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-3">How much did SEPTA fares go up?</h2>

SEPTA says the new base fare for bus and metro trips will be $2.90 starting Sept. 1. See a full list of fare increases <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/fundingcrisis/fare-increases/">here</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-4">Is Amtrak affected by SEPTA cuts?</h2>

According to an Amtrak spokesperson, the reduction in lease money that SEPTA pays to the railroad “<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/amtrak-train-service-septa-funding-budget-cuts-keystone-capitol/">could lead to a deterioration</a> in infrastructure condition and authorized train operating speeds.”

The result, the spokesperson said, would be “negatively impacting Amtrak-operated, PennDOT-sponsored Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian service between Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh, as well as Northeast Corridor services.”

The <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/economy/septa-funding-crisis-could-affect-central-pennsylvanias-amtrak-service-congressman-warns/">Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported</a> that U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D., Pa.) said Amtrak’s CEO told him that the Keystone Service line “will cease to operate.” The line runs between Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and New York City and is heavily used, including by state policymakers.

In its official statement, Amtrak didn’t say anything about lines going away completely.

<h2 id="spl-heading-5">Who funds SEPTA?</h2>

SEPTA gets money from federal, state, and local governments, as well as from bonds and fares.

Currently, Pennsylvania’s 57 transit agencies receive about $2 billion in state aid each year, mostly from sales tax revenue. It is distributed through a formula based on total passengers and vehicle miles traveled, and funds a range of services.

In fiscal year 2024, SEPTA got more than $800 million from the state to support its operations.

<h2 id="spl-heading-6">Why is the Pennsylvania budget late?</h2>

Disagreement over funding transit is a big part of the reason Pennsylvania’s budget is two months late, but it isn’t the only reason.

The state has long run a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-budget-josh-shapiro-surplus-structural-deficit-explainer/">structural deficit</a>, which means it generally spends more annually than it makes in revenue. Finding new cash flows to combat this has been politically difficult.

Republicans, in particular, have insisted that the state budget either cut spending or add new revenue. But the state Senate, which the party controls, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/06/skill-games-budget-pennsylvania-lobbyists-senate-fight-ward-pittman/">has also had particular trouble</a> uniting around leading revenue proposals, like taxing skill games.

In the meantime, the impasse is already leading to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/budget-impasse-pennsylvania-funding-libraries-foster-care-schools-capitol/">pain for local governments and other social service providers</a>.

<h2 id="spl-heading-7">Will SEPTA be saved? Will SEPTA shut down?</h2>

Without additional state action, SEPTA says it will make additional service cuts on Jan. 1. Those include <a href="https://billypenn.com/2025/08/24/septa-cuts-routes-fares-august-2025/">stopping</a> trains at 9 p.m.

SEPTA’s cuts are reversible. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/pennsylvania-septa-transit-cuts-service-reduction-budget-crisis-capitol/">A spokesperson told Spotlight PA</a> that it will take the system around two weeks to restore full service if funding is approved.

But the lingering effects of cuts, even temporary ones, could be significant for the system.

“As fare increases and service reductions push our region toward gridlock, Southeastern Pennsylvania will enter its own death spiral, pulling the rest of the state down with it,” SEPTA says.
