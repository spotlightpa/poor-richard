Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/05/records-obtained-by-spotlight-pennsylvania-and-wesa-reveal-how-pennsylvania-counties-used-tens-of-millions-in-opioid-settlement-dollars/">opioid windfall</a> — expected to reach over $1 billion — has brought hope to the state, where thousands of people annually die from drug overdoses. It also has brought conflict as counties weigh how to use the settlement money.

Records obtained, analyzed, and made public by Spotlight PA and WESA show counties have a wide range of strategies, and highlight the epidemic’s impact on neighborhoods, jails, specialty programs, and other communities and services.

On Thursday, May 30, Spotlight PA hosted a free panel on how counties are using their opioid settlement funds, and what influences these decisions.

<strong>Our panelists included:</strong>

- <strong>Ed Mahon</strong>, investigative reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Kate Giammarise</strong>, reporter, WESA

- <strong>Jordan Scott,</strong> digital advocacy and organizing coordinator, PA Harm Reduction Network

- <strong>Stuart Fisk,</strong> director of the office of behavioral health, Allegheny County Department Human Services
