HARRISBURG — Democrats will retain control of the narrowly divided Pennsylvania state House after Democrat Dan Goughnour won an Allegheny County special election Tuesday, according to unofficial results.

As of 11 p.m., the Associated Press still had not called the second special election of the evening, a close race between East Petersburg Mayor James Malone and County Commissioner Josh Parsons.

However, Parsons <a href="https://x.com/Josh__Parsons/status/1904723673140822150">posted on social media</a> that, &#34;Obviously we are disappointed in the numbers. We are still reviewing them, but it appears we will come up a little short.&#34;

Parsons added that he would have a further statement Wednesday.

At publication time, Malone led with 50% of the vote to Parsons’ 49% with all precincts reporting, according to unofficial results. A third libertarian candidate got just under a percent of the vote.

The Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and party leaders like Gov. Josh Shapiro declared victory for Malone Tuesday night.

Malone had not been expected to win the conservative 36th Senate District. The district, which includes small towns, farmland, and burgeoning exurbs, backed President Donald Trump by 15 percentage points in November.

It has not elected a Democrat since being moved from south-central Pennsylvania via redistricting in the 1980s, though state Democrats have increasingly won voters in the region since the first Trump administration.

The seat was open after state Sen. Ryan Aument resigned in December to take a job with U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R., Pa.). The win does not affect control of the state Senate, and means Republicans’ edge in the upper chamber is now 27-23.

Malone’s <a href="https://www.friendsofjamesmalone.org/">website</a> touted support for public education, housing and “lowering the cost of everyday essentials.”

Parsons, a <a href="https://www.joinjoshparsons.com/accomplishments/">vocal conservative</a> and Trump ally who notably <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/18/lancaster-lnp-newspaper-republican-attacks/">feuded</a> with the county’s newspaper, focused his campaign on his time as commissioner. That included keeping taxes low, opposition to mail voting and COVID-19 <a href="https://oneunitedlancaster.com/coronavirus-news-roundup/officials-say-lancaster-county-will-begin-to-reopen-with-or-without-gov-wolfs-ok/">lockdowns</a><u>, </u>and fighting local libraries over <a href="https://www.wgal.com/article/lancaster-county-commissioner-raises-concerns-about-drag-queen-story-hour-at-lancaster-public-library/60144596">drag queen visit</a><u>s.</u>

The state House district that was up for election includes some small milltowns along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and has been represented by Democrats for the past 60 years.

That win affirms the party will retain its majority in the lower chamber, at least until the next Democratic vacancy. Back at full power, Democrats lead the chamber by a margin of just 102 to 101.

With control of the agenda again secure, Democrats now have additional leverage in upcoming budget talks, as well as the power to decide what bills get a vote and which languish on the table.

The Allegheny County seat was vacant after the sudden death of Democratic state Rep. Matt Gergely in January due to complications from a health emergency late last year.

In Gergely’s place, the district’s voters picked Goughnour, a retired police officer and local school board member. The Associated Press called the race at 9:30 Tuesday evening; Goughnour leads with 63% of the vote against Republican Chuck Davis, a fire chief and local township councilor, according to unofficial results.

Both chambers were in session this week as lawmaking restarted following weeks of budget hearings. Bills that would mandate paid family leave and restrict sports eligibility for transgender girls and women are among the proposals being considered.

While a similar vacancy in the state House in the first months of the previous session led to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/01/pennsylvania-house-rozzi-deadlock-amendment/">an acrimonious partisan battle</a>, this one hasn’t resulted in power struggles or ground action in the Capitol to a halt.

Lawmakers have shown similar signs of compromise when it has come to policy this year. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has already signed two laws since the start of 2025; it took him until May 2023 to sign his first law last session.
