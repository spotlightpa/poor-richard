HARRISBURG — By now, most voters have likely heard about the congested, double-digit field of contenders jockeying in this year’s primary race for the chance to snag the state’s top job of governor.

But there is another crowded primary contest unfolding with far less fanfare: that of lieutenant governor. In all, there are <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/ElectionInfo/FooterLinkReport.aspx?ID=1120">12 people</a> running to become Pennsylvania’s second-in-command — two more than in the governor’s race.

That uneven math is the result of Pennsylvania’s quirky rules for electing top executives. The state is among <a href="https://nlga.us/research/methods-of-election/">a minority</a> that elects its governors and lieutenant governors separately in the primary, but then as a single ticket in the general election.

<script src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version="1" data-spl-src="https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/"></div>

That election method has produced some odd pairings over the years, most recently in Gov. Tom Wolf’s first term, during which his <a href="https://web.archive.org/20210224000533/https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/Mike-Stack-Wolf-feud-politics-Couloumbis.html">icy relationship</a> with then-Lt. Gov. Mike Stack, driven in part by how different they were in both style and personality, became one of the worst-kept secrets in the Capitol.

On paper, as it stands now, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run separately during the primary election.

Off the books, however, candidates often align early on and campaign together even in the months before the primary. That has been the case for this year’s May 17 primary race with <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/josh-shapiro-austin-davis-governor-pa-20220104.html">Attorney General Josh Shapiro and state Rep. Austin Davis</a> of Allegheny County on the Democratic end; and <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/01/mastriano-endorses-fellow-army-veteran-as-his-choice-for-pa-lieutenant-governor.html">Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County and Teddy Daniels</a> on the Republican side of the election ballot.

But it’s all unofficial.

One lawmaker has tried for years to change that. State Sen. Dave Argall (R., Schuylkill) introduced legislation back in 2017 to change the way voters select the lieutenant governor. His proposal would allow Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial nominees to choose a running mate, similar to how the president of the United States selects one.

His measure, Argall said at the time, was inspired by the strained relationship between Wolf and Stack.

Such a change would require a change to the state constitution, which takes time and effort. A proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two consecutive two-year sessions and the language must be identical both times. Then, voters have the final say, deciding via a ballot question.

<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2019&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=133">Argall’s bill</a> passed for the first time in the 2019-2020 session. It appeared to be on track to be approved in the current two-year session — setting the stage for it to appear on the ballot this year — but the proposal has been laden with <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/pennsylvania-constitutional-amendments-voters-id-regulations/">additional proposed election-related changes</a>, clouding its future path.

What remains constant for the moment are the duties of the office. The lieutenant governor’s job is often described as one of the best in the Capitol because it carries with it the clout of the executive — and pays $178,940 annually — without the work or pressures of being governor.

The lieutenant governorship has some prescribed duties, including presiding over the 50-member state Senate and chairing the state Board of Pardons.

But beyond that, lieutenant governors are only as powerful as governors choose to make them. A governor could delegate important research or advocacy work to their lieutenant. Wolf, for instance, tasked Lt. Gov. John Fetterman at the start of his second term with completing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230117013658/https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-lt-gov-fetterman-announce-report-next-steps-after-adult-use-recreational-marijuana-tour/">a report</a> on attitudes toward legalizing adult-use recreational marijuana.

Or they could ignore them completely.

Here is who is running for the office:
