Pennsylvania lawmakers are in the final stages of negotiating the state budget, a process that decides how the government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in the coming fiscal year and beyond.

During his March budget address, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who must ultimately sign the budget into law, proposed a $44.4 billion spending plan that calls for increases in education spending, changes to how State Police are funded, and the state’s first investment into public defenders.

Legislators in both major parties have embraced the plan as a fine starting point while still pursuing their own priorities.

But what goes into finalizing such a massive budget? Who has the final say and how can residents make their voices heard? To answer these questions and more, Spotlight held a panel on the budget process. Watch it below.

Our panelists were:

- <b>Stephen Caruso</b>, capitol reporter, Spotlight PA

- <b>Mustafa Rashed</b>, president and CEO, Bellevue Strategies

- <b>Bill DeWeese</b>, former speaker, Pennsylvania House
