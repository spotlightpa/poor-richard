Unlike most candidate forums in which politicians are asked the same policy questions over and over, the purpose of the Ultimate Job Interview is to interview candidates for the jobs they are seeking by asking them the kinds of questions about leadership, character, management, experience, and priorities that job applicants face.

The event is hosted by Spotlight PA in partnership with <a href="https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/">The Philadelphia Citizen</a> as an extension of the <a href="https://www.everyvoice-everyvote.org/">Every Voice, Every Vote initiative</a> of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism. Additional presenting media sponsors will be added soon.

The Ultimate Job Interview series is a part of Every Voice, Every Vote, a collaborative project managed by The Lenfest Institute for Journalism. Lead support for Every Voice, Every Vote in 2024 and 2025 is provided by the William Penn Foundation with additional funding from The Lenfest Institute for Journalism, Comcast NBC Universal, The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Henry L. Kimelman Family Foundation, Judy and Peter Leone, Arctos Foundation, Wyncote Foundation, 25th Century Foundation, and Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation.
