<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, non-partisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

In 2021, a handful of politicians will wield power over one of the most consequential and overlooked aspects of our democracy: redrawing Pennsylvania’s political districts.

They can dictate who belongs in their districts, and who doesn’t; who keeps their seat, and who loses it; and who gets representation, and who gets left out. And all of that has ripple effects.

On Tuesday, March 16 at 5 p.m., join Spotlight PA and our expert panelists in discussing redistricting, gerrymandering, and why it matters to our local communities. You can <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/redistricting?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=profile_web&utm_campaign=profile" target=_blank>RSVP for FREE by clicking here</a>. Our panel includes:

- <b>Marie Albiges</b>, Spotlight PA’s redistricting, census, and election reporter

- <b>Salewa Ogunmefun</b>, executive director of <a href="https://www.pennsylvaniavoice.org/">Pennsylvania Voice </a>

- <b>Robert Saleem Holbrook</b>, executive director of the <a href="https://abolitionistlawcenter.org/">Abolitionist Law Center</a>.

You can <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/redistricting?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=profile_web&utm_campaign=profile" target=_blank>RSVP for FREE and submit your questions in advance here</a>.
