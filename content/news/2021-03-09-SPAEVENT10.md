In 2021, a handful of politicians will wield power over one of the most consequential and overlooked aspects of our democracy: redrawing Pennsylvania’s political districts.

They can dictate who belongs in their districts, and who doesn’t; who keeps their seat, and who loses it; and who gets representation, and who gets left out. And all of that has ripple effects.

On Tuesday, March 16 at 5 p.m., Spotlight PA and our expert panelists discussed redistricting, gerrymandering, and why it matters to our local communities. Our panel included:

- <b>Marie Albiges</b>, Spotlight PA’s redistricting, census, and election reporter

- <b>Salewa Ogunmefun</b>, executive director of <a href="https://www.pennsylvaniavoice.org/">Pennsylvania Voice </a>

- <b>Robert Saleem Holbrook</b>, executive director of the <a href="https://abolitionistlawcenter.org/">Abolitionist Law Center</a>.
