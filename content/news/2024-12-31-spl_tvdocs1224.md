HARRISBURG — A series of Spotlight PA investigations has revealed <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/12/pa-medical-marijuana-cards-telemedicine-doctor-oversight/">weak oversight of doctors</a> in Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program, prompted <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/medical-marijuana-oversight-limits-legislation/">efforts to change state law</a>, and led to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/01/medical-marijuana-new-academic-research/">greater transparency</a> from the state health department.

The findings have also raised questions from experts, including fellow medical marijuana doctors, about the quality of care many patients receive when they seek a medical marijuana card.

Records obtained through <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/08/pa-medical-marijuana-program-addiction-treatment-court-order/">legal victories</a> bolstered <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/medical-marijuana-doctor-data-ordered-released/">Spotlight PA’s investigations</a>. A first-of-its-kind analysis revealed how <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/01/pa-medical-marijuana-certification-card-anxiety/">anxiety disorders came to dominate</a> the big business of medical marijuana cards in Pennsylvania, despite <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/01/pennsylvania-medical-marijuana-anxiety-research-qualifying-conditions/">limited evidence of the drug’s effectiveness</a> and concerns about its potential to worsen anxiety symptoms.

Additional records obtained by Spotlight PA show a small number of doctors approve a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/12/pennsylvania-medical-marijuana-top-doctor-certification/">disproportionately large share</a> of medical marijuana cards in Pennsylvania, and that the Department of Health has <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/08/medical-marijuana-card-doctor-misconduct/">rarely blocked doctors </a>from joining the program based on prior discipline.

To spread the reach of this work, Spotlight PA produced broadcast-ready video segments of these investigations. The segments were created by Mitch Blacher, a veteran broadcast journalist, as part of a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-tv-news-spotlight-pennsylvania-nexstar/">first-of-its-kind partnership</a> with a group of Nexstar television stations.
