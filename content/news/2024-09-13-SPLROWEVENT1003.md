On Nov. 5, Pennsylvania voters will choose their next attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer. These row office positions come with considerable power over the state’s finances, the enforcement of its laws, and how it monitors for waste and fraud.

Democrat Erin McClelland will face off against Republican incumbent Stacy Garrity for treasurer. Philadelphia state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta is up against sitting Republican Tim DeFoor for auditor general. And Democrat Eugene DePasquale is competing with Republican Dave Sunday in the open race for attorney general.

Reporter Stephen Caruso and Chris Borick, pollster and political science professor at Muhlenberg College, held a live webinar on Oct. 3 covering everything you need to know about these candidates’ histories and campaign pledges, and the offices they hope to win.
