This November, Pennsylvania voters will select a new state Supreme Court justice and new judges to sit on Commonwealth and Superior Courts. They will also decide whether two judges on Superior Court get another term. The winning candidates will have considerable power over the interpretation of state laws and weigh in on consequential issues such as election administration and abortion.

To help you cast an informed vote, Spotlight PA hosted a panel on the candidates’ backgrounds and records and how their terms would impact state law. Watch the discussion with government reporters Kate Huangpu and Stephen Caruso below.
