HARRISBURG — A sweeping bill to overhaul the commonwealth’s election laws has passed the Pennsylvania House. Its changes would include creating in-person early voting, giving counties more time to process mail ballots, and requiring counties to use mail ballot drop boxes.

But it doesn’t include one provision that will likely be politically important: A mandatory voter ID requirement, something that Republicans, who control the state Senate, have always seen as crucial to any election law deal.

State House leaders in both parties <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/05/voter-identification-election-modernization-pennsylvania-legislature-deadlock-deals/">have lately said they are open to voter ID</a> after years of partisan fights.The chamber even advanced a standalone bill, sponsored by two swing district lawmakers, that would create a lenient voter ID requirement for all in-person voters.

However, a top House Democrat said that bill was pulled from this week’s voting calendar because some House Republicans weren&#39;t going to vote for it. Combined with limited House Democratic support, it means the proposal was short the 102 votes needed for final passage.

“In the past, Republicans have clamored for this type of legislation,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) said. “They seem to have retreated in that support.”

In a statement, House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R., Bedford) acknowledged that Republicans have “specific concerns with the details” of the voter ID proposal and that talks are ongoing. Spotlight PA and Votebeat previously reported that Republicans typically back stricter voter ID proposals than the one currently before the House.

State Rep. Tom Mehaffie (R., Dauphin), a co-sponsor of the voter ID proposal, told Spotlight PA that he feels “extremely confident this is exactly what voter ID should look like in Pennsylvania because it makes it constitutional.”

He said he hoped that lawmakers could pass the measure sometime when they return to session in June.

However, even if Mehaffie’s bill passes, the proposal would likely meet a frosty reception in the GOP-controlled state Senate.

In a statement, Kate Flessner, spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana), said that the upper chamber has “been consistent and clear that Voter ID should be implemented through the Constitutional Amendment process,” and not as simple legislation, as the House’s bill, if passed, would be.

“The legislation that is sent over from the House will be referred to the appropriate Senate standing committee for review,” Flesser concluded.

The broad election bill, sans voter ID, passed the narrowly divided chamber 102 to 101, with no votes from Republicans.

Meanwhile, election officials on the ground are watching Harrisburg’s maneuvers closely, and county and local election officials told Votebeat and Spotlight PA they worry the House’s bill has contradictions that would make implementing some provisions difficult.
