HARRISBURG — Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro’s transition team is made up of a leadership board, personnel committee, legal counsel, and seven advisory committees that are divided into subcommittees. All these groups are tasked with advising on policy, troubleshooting in state departments, and in some cases, recommending candidates and conducting interviews.

The more than 300 members of the transition team, which will operate until Shapiro is sworn in Jan. 17, include lots of the most politically connected people in the commonwealth. Some are <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/12/pa-election-2022-governor-josh-shapiro-transition-teams/">donors to Shapiro</a>, and many have long histories in state politics and policy. Some of those <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/12/pa-governor-josh-shapiro-transition-republicans-school-choice/#spl-blume">histories are complicated</a>. Members of past gubernatorial transitions have also sometimes gone on to serve in prominent administrative roles.

Here’s the full list of the more than 300 people on the team, broken down by areas of focus:
