HARRISBURG — After weeks of tense, secretive negotiations on Pennsylvania’s budget, legislative leaders have agreed to a $47.6 billion spending deal that falls short of the investment in public schools Democrats first proposed and is far more than Republicans wanted to spend.

Budget talks centered on education after a court ruled last year that the state unconstitutionally underfunds poor districts.

Final details were still under wraps Thursday as each caucus discussed them internally, but multiple sources briefed on the plan told Spotlight PA that it includes more than $1 billion in new education spending split among multiple budget lines. Much of that new spending would flow to Pennsylvania’s poorest school districts.

Democrats and public school advocates had hoped for a much larger investment, given the commonwealth’s roughly $15 billion surplus.

New spending also targets special education, school safety, mental health, and construction.

The deal had not been considered by the full state House and Senate as of 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Votes were expected in the coming hours.

In his February budget address, Gov. Josh Shapiro <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/02/pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-budget-2024-education-legal-marijuana-skill-games/">asked for $1 billion</a> in new spending to flow directly to K-12 schools, primarily those in poor districts, as well as $525 million for additional, school-based programs.

State House Democrats advanced a bill last month that called for a $6 billion K-12 investment that would be doled out in chunks over the next seven years.

While Republicans acknowledged the Commonwealth Court ruling would mean some additional spending on education, they repeatedly rejected Democrats’ requests for higher spend numbers, citing concerns about future deficits and support for alternatives to public schooling.

The deal would also reduce the amount of tuition cyber charter schools receive from public schools for students with disabilities, according to sources briefed on the plan.

Charter schools, including cyber charters, are funded via direct payments from public districts that are calculated based on the district’s per-student spending.

If a student has a disability, their tuition is built on that base rate for the district, plus a standard percentage of its spending for all disability services — regardless of the kind of disability the student has. Public school advocates often criticize this system as unnecessarily inflating costs for many disabled students and burdening public districts.
