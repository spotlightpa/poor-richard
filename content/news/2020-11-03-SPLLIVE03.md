## How to report problems or get voting info

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

If you need last-minute voting information, you can seek official answers from the Pennsylvania Department of State by calling 1-877-VOTESPA. The nonpartisan <a href="https://866ourvote.org/" target=_blank>Election Protection coalition</a> has its own hotline, as well: 866-OUR-VOTE.

If you need to lodge a complaint about something you experience while voting, you can call the state’s hotline (1-877-VOTESPA) or reach the department using this <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/ReportElectionComplaints.aspx" target=_blank>form</a>.

And as part of a collaboration with ProPublica’s “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/electionland">Electionland</a>” project, you can report problems at the polls to Spotlight PA <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-2020-election-day-voting-problems-machines-ballots-lawsuits/" target="_blank">using this form. </a><i>— Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>

## What you need to know before heading to the polls

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

The big day is finally here. If you’ve already voted by mail, congrats — your work is done.

But for those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx" target=_blank>here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-poll-watchers-can-cant-do-election-day-explainer/" target=_blank>Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/pages/drop-box.aspx" target=_blank>so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came in the mail? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-by-Provisional-Ballot.aspx" target=_blank>provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx#emergency%20absentee" target=_blank>Read about those here</a>.

The word of the day is patience. Election officials can only begin processing mail-in and absentee ballots this morning, which means it may take days to report the full results. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pa-election-2020-mail-ballots-precanvassing/" target=_blank>Some counties aren’t planning to begin the process until tomorrow</a>. So if you see any candidates or campaigns declaring victory tonight in hotly contested races, chances are their celebrations are premature. <i>— Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>
