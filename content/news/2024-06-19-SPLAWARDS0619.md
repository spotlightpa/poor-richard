Spotlight PA’s unique, voter-centric coverage of Pennsylvania’s 2023 judicial elections — focused on helping people understand how and why these races affect the real, day-to-day issues they care about most —&nbsp;has earned the prestigious statewide Public Service Award.

The coverage, “Why Judges Matter,” encompassed dozens of stories, including candidate guides, explainers of how the courts and judges work, virtual events, extensive Spanish translations, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/10/pennsylvania-judges-supreme-superior-commonwealth-court-interactive-tool/">an interactive online tool</a> showing how court decisions shape important policy matters from abortion to gun rights.

In total, Spotlight PA was honored with 6 statewide awards by the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association.

The “Why Judges Matter” reporting effort earned the award in competition with all other news organizations in the state, several far larger, recognizing “a news company that has made a significant contribution to the betterment of its community through public service leadership.” The staff-wide effort was led by Spotlight PA’s Democracy Editor, Elizabeth Estrada.

This is the <a href="https://panewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/Awards/Keystone_Awards_Professional/Past_Winners/Past-John-Bull-Award-Winners.pdf">fourth-straight year</a> Spotlight PA has received this honor. The newsroom was previously recognized for its efforts to encourage more diversified sourcing in reporting across Pennsylvania, its unrivaled coverage of redistricting, and the 2022 gubernatorial election.

The newsroom also received the prestigious John V.R. Bull Freedom of Information Award for "Richest Little City," an investigation into how the manager of a small Pennsylvania city <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/richest-little-city/">landed at the center of one of the most sweeping political corruption cases</a> in the state in recent years.

Through dozens of interviews and public record requests, as well as data analysis, reporters Min Xian and Angela Couloumbis found the former city manager of DuBois, Herm Suplizio, capitalized on powers from key positions he held, a network of unlikely political connections, and the trust he amassed in his community to gain near-unfettered access to taxpayer and nonprofit funds. Suplizio’s case is pending in federal court, and he has pleaded not guilty.

The special prize is awarded to one newsroom of any size in Pennsylvania each year for “exceptional work advancing or upholding the cause of Freedom of Information during the past year.” This is the <a href="https://panewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/Awards/Keystone_Awards_Professional/Past_Winners/Past-John-Bull-Award-Winners.pdf">third time Spotlight PA has received the honor.</a>

“Since the day we launched in 2019, our goal has been to restore the role of journalism in our state as a fearless check on the powerful, and to inspire people to get involved and drive real, positive change for the future,” said Spotlight PA CEO &amp; President Christopher Baxter. “These awards embody all that Spotlight PA was created to be, and every reader and supporter should take immense pride in helping build and sustain the journalism our state deserves.”

On the national level, Spotlight PA also received high-profile recognition for its journalism this year— named a finalist by Investigative Reporters and Editors for the special Freedom of Information Award for <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/unproven-unsafe/">a year-long investigation into Pennsylvania’s often secretive medical marijuana program</a>.

The newsroom also received third place in the education category from the National Headliner Awards for Wyatt Massey’s <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/missed-conduct/">coverage of Penn State University</a>. Most recently, Spotlight PA and WESA took second place in the Public Media Journalists Association’s Collaborative Effort category for their <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/opioid-settlement-money/">joint efforts to track the state’s spending of opioid settlement money</a>.
