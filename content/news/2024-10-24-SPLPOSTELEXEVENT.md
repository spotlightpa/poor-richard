All eyes are on Pennsylvania as the tight race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris enters its final weeks.

Along with being a key swing state in the presidential race, voters in the commonwealth will choose their next treasurer, auditor general, and attorney general — key row office positions with power over Pennsylvania’s finances, law enforcement, and more. Plus, voters’ choices in their state House and Senate races could flip control of one or both chambers.

On top of all that, Pennsylvania’s election results will likely be reported <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/10/pennsylvania-election-mail-ballots-precanvassing-101/">more slowly than other swing states’</a> and will be under intense scrutiny. Election officials are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pennsylvania-election-mail-in-ballot-processing-60-minutes/">already warning</a> of the potential for disinformation about the results, as <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/trumps-latest-bogus-claim-about-mail-in-vote-fraud-in-pennsylvania/">Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-delivers-cash-conspiracies-pennsylvania-voters-2024-10-22/">his surrogates</a> have already rekindled his baseless 2020 claims of fraud.

To help you make sense of what happened on Election Day and what comes next, Spotlight PA Government Editor Katie Meyer will host a live panel Tuesday, Nov. 12 from 6-7 p.m. on Zoom. We’ll also take audience questions.
