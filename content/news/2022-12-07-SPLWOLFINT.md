After eight years in office, Gov. Tom Wolf will relinquish his seat as Pennsylvania’s top official to fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro.

He presided as governor during a rocky period for Pennsylvania, and his responses to climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis, and other statewide issues frequently put him at odds with Republican legislative leaders.

In this interview with Spotlight PA reporters Stephen Caruso and Angela Couloumbis, Wolf reflects on the legacy of his administration and discusses the impact of his many decisions. Watch below.
