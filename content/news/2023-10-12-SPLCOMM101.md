## Pa. Commonwealth Court 101

The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania is one of two intermediate appellate courts in the state and is made up of nine judges. Established in 1968, the court has a unique mandate <a href="http://pacchs.org/">among appellate courts in the United States</a>: It presides specifically over civil actions brought against the commonwealth, including state and local governments, and with regulatory agencies. When lawsuits are filed by or against Pennsylvania, Commonwealth Court also acts as a trial court.

Many of the state Supreme Court’s most notable cases are initially heard by Commonwealth Court, and the two courts’ decisions sometimes differ. In 2020, for instance, the lower court ruled in favor of a handful of Republicans seeking to delay certification or disqualify ballots in that year’s heavily litigated elections — victories that <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/meet-the-pa-commonwealth-court-judges-whove-recently-sided-with-republicans-on-election-rulings-only-to-be-overturned-by-higher-courts/">were ultimately overturned by the state Supreme Court</a>.

Commonwealth Court judges get their seats in partisan elections, then face a nonpartisan retention vote every 10 years. These retention votes usually succeed.

Commonwealth Court is currently GOP-controlled, with five Republicans on the bench, three Democrats, and one vacancy. Democrat Matt Wolf was <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-election-2023-results-commonwealth-court-matt-wolf-megan-martin/">elected to fill that vacancy</a> during the November 2023 election. He will be sworn in this January.
