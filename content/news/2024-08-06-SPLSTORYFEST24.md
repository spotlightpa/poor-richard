Philly Story Fest is back. Spotlight PA<strong> </strong>is partnering with Back Pocket Media for a second year to bring the best stories from Philadelphia to one stage.<strong></strong>

Danielle Ohl, Spotlight PA’s justice reporter, will share how she and Brittany Hailer, co-founder of the Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism, reported on <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/03/pa-competency-local-solutions/">Pennsylvania’s broken “competency” review system</a> and one woman caught in the trap. <strong></strong>

<a href="http://storyfest.org">Philly Story Fest</a> brings journalists and locals together for a night of art, entertainment, and storytelling by and for the people of Philly. Think of it as a podcast, but live and on stage. It will take place on Sept. 25 and 26 at the historic Bok Building (1901 South 9th St.)

Journalists from Spotlight PA, The Inquirer, Philly Mag, WURD, Philadelphia Citizen, WXPN, Resolve Philly, Technical.ly, Streets Dept, and more will go behind the scenes of their reporting, inviting readers into a world they’ve only observed from the outside. Artists and local raconteurs will also share surprising and hysterical stories live from the stage.

Early bird tickets are $21. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/philly-story-fest-tickets-949168156507?aff=SpotlightPA"><strong>Reserve here</strong></a>.
