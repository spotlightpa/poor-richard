HARRISBURG — A Pennsylvania redistricting panel wants to hear from the public about its proposed state House and Senate maps.

The maps were created by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, a five-person panel composed of the top leaders from the General Assembly and an independent chair.

The public can <a href="https://www.redistricting.state.pa.us/">provide feedback online</a> or at meetings until Jan. 18. The panel then has 30 days to consider the comments before voting on a final map, which could be challenged in court. The state’s congressional map is <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pa-congressional-maps-proposed-redistricting/">created and approved in a separate process</a>.
