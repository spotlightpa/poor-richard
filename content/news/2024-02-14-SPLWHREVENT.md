Pennsylvania launched its Whole-Home Repairs Program in 2022 to help residents fix issues like unsafe wiring, leaky roofs, and broken furnaces.

Thousands applied for the funding, but the overwhelming demand for the $125 million program left counties unable to help every applicant. After the program was left out of the final deal on last year’s budget, advocates are now pushing for more funding, and consistency in grant distribution.<br/><br/>Gov. Josh Shapiro&#39;s recent budget proposal included an additional $50 million for the program. The final budget deal will be hashed out in Harrisburg in the coming months.

To discuss the issue, Spotlight PA held a panel on the status and history of the Whole-Home Repairs program, and on how advocates want to see it improved. Watch the talk below.

<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>

- <strong>Charlotte Keith,</strong> investigative reporter, Spotlight PA

- <strong>Nikil Saval</strong>, Democratic state senator (Philadelphia)

- <strong>Angelo Ortega, </strong>member leader, Make the Road Pennsylvania

- <strong>Armando Jimenez</strong>, deputy organizing director, Make the Road Pennsylvania
