This May, Democrats and Republicans will head to the polls to consider judicial candidates — including one for the state Supreme Court — while all Pennsylvania voters (that includes you, independents and minority-party members!) will be asked to consider <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/04/pa-election-primary-2021-ballot-questions-guide/">four ballot questions</a>.

While two of the ballot measures are non-controversial, the others pertaining to Gov. Tom Wolf’s emergency powers have <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/pennsylvania-coronavirus-tom-wolf-business-closures-disaster-declaration-amendment/">caused quite the stir</a> during the coronavirus pandemic.

On Tuesday, May 4 at 5 p.m., join <b>Spotlight PA Deputy Editor Sarah Anne Hughes </b>and <b>WHYY’s Politics Reporter Katie Meyer</b> as they break down what you need to know before you vote. Plus, they’ll answer your questions.
