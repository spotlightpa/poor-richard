HARRISBURG — The Online News Association has recognized two recent investigations by Spotlight PA — an independent, nonpartisan newsroom dedicated to covering the state government and urgent statewide issues — as <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/winners/2021/" target="_blank">finalists for a national award honoring innovation and excellence in online investigative journalism</a>.

<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/mariner-east-pipeline/" target="_blank">“At Risk, In the Dark,”</a> an investigative series focused on emergency preparedness around the Mariner East pipeline system, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/the-hidden-tab/" target="_blank">“The Hidden Tab,”</a> an ongoing investigation into spending by Pennsylvania lawmakers, were both named finalists for the Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award.

In “At Risk, In the Dark,” investigative reporter Rebecca Moss painstakingly chronicled the history of the Mariner East system and preparedness should something go wrong. She found <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-mariner-east-pipeline-accident-emergency-plans-investigation/" target="_blank">secrecy and a patchwork of emergency plans have left many communities in the dark</a> about what to do in case of an accident. As part of that project, she and newsroom developer Daniel Simmons-Ritchie created <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/mariner-east-pipeline-interactive-map-explore/" target="_blank">an interactive explainer of the system and its history</a>.

Other reporting from the series includes:

- <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/sunoco-mariner-east-pipelines-emergency-plans-danger/">Emergency plans fail to consider complexity of Mariner East pipelines, and those most at risk in an accident</a>

In “The Hidden Tab,” investigative reporter Angela Couloumbis — in partnership with a team at The Caucus, and with help from students at Temple University — examined how Pennsylvania taxpayers foot a huge bill each year to run the state’s full-time legislature but are <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/05/pa-legislature-expense-accounts-hidden-legislative-privilege/" target="_blank">blocked from many of the details of that spending</a>. As a result of the reporting, the Senate has <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/09/pa-senate-spending-records-online-historic/" target="_blank">for the first time begun posting details of lawmaker spending</a> from its chamber online.
