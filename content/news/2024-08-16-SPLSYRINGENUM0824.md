HARRISBURG — About a year ago, Spotlight PA and WESA started looking into a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/11/pennsylvania-opioid-settlement-syringe-services-harm-reduction/">conflicting part</a> of Pennsylvania&#39;s opioid windfall.

The multibillion dollar settlements that <a href="https://www.naag.org/issues/opioids/">attorneys general</a> reached with drug companies say expanding syringe services should be a priority for the money. But those programs are widely considered illegal in most of Pennsylvania under our drug paraphernalia law.

Supporters say these programs help connect people with treatment and <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&amp;SPick=20230&amp;cosponId=39917">make communities safer </a>by reducing the presence of discarded needles. Some lawmakers in Harrisburg have <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/02/pennsylvania-syringe-service-legalization-bill/">raised concerns</a> that the programs condone illegal drug use or fail to make communities safer.

Here are the figures that stand out from the coverage, and what they show:

<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/02/pennsylvania-syringe-service-legalization-bill/"><strong>1</strong></a> — Republican lawmaker who voted in favor of a syringe services legalization bill during a committee vote in February. That lawmaker, state Rep. Jim Rigby of Cambria County, has talked about how <a href="https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2024-02-15/bill-to-legalize-clean-syringe-programs-advances-in-pa-house">serving as a police chief</a> influenced <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/top-stories/if-it-saves-one-life-i-think-its-worth-it-syringe-service-program-could-come-to-pa/">his position</a>.

“They don’t prepare you to go tell a mother and father their child is dead from an overdose,” he told Spotlight PA. “... If we save one, that’s a start, so I’m ready to make that start.”

The bill, which passed out of committee with <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/RCC/PUBLIC/listVoteSummaryH.cfm?sYear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;cteeCde=60&amp;theDate=02/14/2024&amp;RollCallId=1314">unanimous Democratic support</a>, awaits action in the full House.

<strong>3</strong> — Pennsylvania counties (Cambria, Crawford, and Luzerne) flagged in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27763996/">nationwide assessment</a> of communities potentially vulnerable to the rapid spread of HIV and to new or continuing high rates of hepatitis C infections among people who inject drugs.

<strong>5 times — </strong>how much more likely new users of a needle exchange were to enter drug treatment, compared to similar individuals who had never used an exchange, according to <a href="https://www.jsatjournal.com/article/S0740-5472(00)00104-5/fulltext">a widely cited 2000 study.</a>

<strong>8 times</strong> — how many more improperly disposed of syringes researchers found during walkthroughs in a city without needle and syringe programs, compared to a city with them, according to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22209091/">2012 study</a> cited by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syringe-services-programs/php/safety-effectiveness.html">CDC.</a>

<strong>38 </strong>— states that explicitly or implicitly authorize syringe services through statute or regulation, according to a survey last year from the <a href="https://legislativeanalysis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Syringe-Services-Programs-Summary-of-State-Laws.pdf">Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association</a>, a nonprofit group that researches laws nationwide. Pennsylvania is not one of them.

<strong>$150,000</strong> — how much opioid settlement funding was <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/02/opioid-settlement-syringe-favor-cancelled/">pulled from a nonprofit in Western Pennsylvania late last year</a> based on concerns over syringe services.

<strong>1992</strong> — the year then-Mayor Ed Rendell, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20210602143030/executive-order-1992-04.pdf">issued an executive order </a>to allow syringe services in Philadelphia.

<strong>2008 </strong>– the year Allegheny County Council <a href="https://alleghenycounty.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1700380&amp;GUID=4EAEF006-D2C2-4A07-A919-798D5E49E638&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=needle+exchange">adopted a needle exchange ordinance</a>.

<strong>$325,000</strong> — how much opioid settlement money Allegheny County <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/06/pennsylvania-opioid-cash-trust-decisions/">reported</a> dedicating to supporting “access to sterile syringes and other safer drug use supplies,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24769679-allegheny-county#document/p33">as of the end of last year</a>.<strong></strong>
