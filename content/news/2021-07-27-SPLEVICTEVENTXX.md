Thousands of Pennsylvanians are at risk of losing their homes as counties across the state remain backlogged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/20210506004930/https://www.dhs.pa.gov/ERAP/Pages/ERAP.aspx" target="_blank">applications for rental assistance</a>. These are difficult systems to manage, not least because each county has its own provisions and resources.

On Thursday, Aug. 5 at 5 p.m., <b>Charlotte Keith </b>of Spotlight PA, <b>Kyle Webster </b>of <a href="https://actionhousing.org/" target="_blank">Action Housing</a>, and <b>Michelle Dempsky</b> of <a href="https://www.lasp.org/" target="_blank">Legal Aid of Southeastern PA</a> participated in a free panel and Q&amp;A on everything we know about evictions and rental assistance in Pennsylvania.

A full recording of the event is available below.
