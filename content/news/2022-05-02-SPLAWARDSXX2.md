HARRISBURG — Spotlight PA’s unprecedented commitment to coverage of redistricting in Pennsylvania during the past year has earned two of the most prestigious statewide prizes in journalism, among other awards.

In total, Spotlight PA — in competition with all other news organizations in the state — won three of the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association’s top prizes.

The <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/topics/redistricting/">redistricting coverage</a> won the Public Service Award, given to a single newsroom in Pennsylvania each year that has made a significant contribution to the betterment of its community through public service leadership. This is the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/05/spotlight-pa-journalism-awards-mariner-east-coronavirus-business-waivers-diverse-source-database/">second straight year</a> Spotlight PA has been recognized with this award.

Additionally, Spotlight PA’s lead redistricting reporter, Kate Huangpu, was honored with The Lenfest Institute Emerging Journalist Award, given to one young reporter in the state each year in recognition of their talent and promise.

And Spotlight PA’s interactive map comparison tool — which allowed readers to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-house-senate-districts-lookup-tool/">search their address to see how their political districts would change</a> under the newly drawn maps — received first place in the Best Web Use category from the state chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.

Spotlight PA was the only newsroom in Pennsylvania and one of the only in the country to dedicate a reporter for an entire year to redistricting. The initiative focused on the immense importance the process plays in determining political power and representation for years to come.

In other categories, Spotlight PA was awarded the statewide Freedom of Information Award from the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association (PNA) for its collaborative investigative reporting with The Philadelphia Inquirer on the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/the-psers-scandal/">troubles facing the Public School Employees’ Retirement System</a>.
