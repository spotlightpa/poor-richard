In the midst of launching another bid for governor, Josh Shapiro releases his new memoir <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/where-we-keep-the-light-josh-shapiro?variant=44415011684386"><em>Where We Keep the Light: Stories From a Life of Service</em></a><em>. </em>HarperCollins Publishers writes that Shapiro “relates powerful stories about his family, faith, and what matters to Americans tired of all the divisiveness and distrust in our leaders.”

As a part of Spotlight PA’s book club, Booklight PA, investigative reporters Angela Couloumbis, Stephen Caruso, and the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Gillian McGoldrick dissected the memoir and compared it to their own years of reporting. Watch their conversation in the video below.
