HARRISBURG — Small business owner Erin McClelland won Tuesday’s primary election to snag the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania treasurer, a surprise victory that sets the stage for a tough matchup this fall with incumbent Republican Stacy Garrity.

The Associated Press called the race for McClelland at 10:11 p.m. Unofficial results show McClelland with 56% of the vote to opponent Ryan Bizzarro’s 44%.

McClelland won Tuesday’s election without the endorsement of the state Democratic Party — it backed Bizzarro, a state representative from Erie. Bizzarro also significantly outraised McClelland, a former substance abuse counselor and project manager for the Allegheny County Department of Human Services.

On the GOP side, Garrity ran unopposed for a second four-year term.

Normally a low-profile race in a presidential election year, this primary campaign for treasurer featured heightened rhetoric as well as thorny questions over mistakes in how McClelland filed <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/mcclellands-pa-treasurer-campaign-raised-and-spent-money-months-before-it-officially-existed/">political fundraising reports</a>.

The Pennsylvania Treasury does not make or decide policy on voting, reproductive rights, or other high-profile issues. Instead, the office is <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/pennsylvania-election-2024-treasurer-primary-candidates-stacy-garrity-ryan-bizzarro-erin-mcclelland/">the custodian of more than $150 billion</a> in state funds and directs the investment of billions in state savings.

It also manages or administers several high-profile programs, including the college and career savings program and the state’s unclaimed property program. The latter in particular became a focus of debate during the primary campaign.

During her tenure, Garrity has taken credit for upgrading and fast-tracking the program to make it easier for Pennsylvanians to find out if they have unclaimed money (for instance, a refund check that wasn’t cashed or a gift card that wasn’t used) and reunite them with that cash after filing a claim.

Bizzarro has countered that Garrity’s changes to the program are overblown, and her <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/03/unclaimed-property-pennsylvania-treasurer/">claim of improving it misleading</a>.

The race between Garrity and McClelland is expected to intensify in the countdown to the November election. Democrats hope to reclaim the row office they lost in 2020, when <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-treasurer-joe-torsella-loses-republican-stacy-garrity-20201110.html">Garrity defeated</a> then-incumbent Democratic state Treasurer Joe Torsella in a major upset.

Torsella’s campaign spent more than $1.8 million on that year’s race, compared to Garrity’s $217,000.

This year, Garrity is entering the race with a far more padded campaign bank account.

As of April 8, the latest campaign finance data available, Garrity had just over $638,340 in the bank. Because she had no opponent in the primary, she was able to save much of her cash for the general election.

Among Democrats, Bizzarro had a clear fundraising advantage.

Between the start of the year and April 8, Bizzarro raised just shy of $250,000 and had $260,557 in his campaign account.

McClelland, in contrast, raised $5,986 since the start of the year and had $87,629 in her account as of April 8 (this after loaning her campaign $100,000 of her own money).

It is not yet certain if any third-party candidates will be on the ballot for the treasurer’s race. Those candidates have until August to gather signatures to have their names listed on the ballot.

So far, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/04/pennsylvania-election-2024-forward-party-attorney-general-treasurer-ballot-requirements/">the Forward Party has said it intends to jump into the race</a>. The party describes itself as a landing ground for moderate candidates who do not align with their party’s more progressive or conservative-leaning ideas.

For treasurer, the party wants to run Chris Foster, a former Democrat from Allegheny County who has spent most of his career as a tennis pro.
