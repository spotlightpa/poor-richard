Gov. Josh Shapiro wants to send more money to Pennsylvania’s poorest public schools, tax skill games, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/marijuana-cannabis-recreational-legalization-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-budget-gop-support/">legalize</a> recreational cannabis <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-budget-legal-weed/">as part of his $51.4 billion budget proposal</a>.

In his February address, Shapiro also threw his support behind <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/eviction-sealing-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-statewide-policy/">sealing certain eviction records</a> and increasing state oversight of private equity acquisitions of hospitals and nursing homes.

Lawmakers would need to use the last of Pennsylvania’s $3 billion surplus plus $1.6 billion from the rainy day fund to cover the 8% spending increase. Republicans who control the state Senate say to save instead of spend.

To unpack the proposal and answer your questions, Spotlight PA’s Katie Meyer will host a live conversation with state Rep. Jordan Harris (D., Philadelphia), who leads the House’s powerful Appropriations Committee. The Q&amp;A will take place Thursday, Feb. 20 from 6-7 p.m. on Zoom.
