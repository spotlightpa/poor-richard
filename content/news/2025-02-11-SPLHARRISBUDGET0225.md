Gov. Josh Shapiro wants to send more money to Pennsylvania’s poorest public schools, tax skill games, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/marijuana-cannabis-recreational-legalization-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-budget-gop-support/">legalize</a> recreational cannabis <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-budget-legal-weed/">as part of his $51.5 billion budget proposal</a>.

In his February address, Shapiro also threw his support behind <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/eviction-sealing-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-statewide-policy/">sealing certain eviction records</a> and increasing state oversight of private equity acquisitions of hospitals and nursing homes.

Lawmakers would need to use the last of Pennsylvania’s $3 billion surplus plus $1.6 billion from the rainy day fund to cover the 8% spending increase. Republicans who control the state Senate say to save instead of spend.

On Feb. 20, Spotlight PA’s Katie Meyer hosted a live conversation with state Rep. Jordan Harris (D., Philadelphia), who leads the House’s powerful Appropriations Committee, to unpack Shapiro’s proposals, discuss the commonwealth’s financial picture, and much more. You can watch the event below.
