A new analysis of state data shows widening gaps in education spending between affluent and poor communities — and divides in academic performance.

The report was prepared for a Commonwealth Court judge as part of an ongoing suit that contends Pennsylvania is failing to provide a “thorough and efficient” system of education. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-public-school-funding-analysis-philadelphia-reading-lancaster/" target="_blank">Among its findings</a>: on average, the poorest 20% of school districts have $7,866 less per student than the wealthiest 20%.

Use the chart below to see how much your school district is owed, according to the new analysis.
