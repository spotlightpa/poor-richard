HARRISBURG — Join Spotlight PA for its first in-person summit on<strong> </strong>Wednesday, Oct. 11, from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Whitaker Center in Harrisburg. Spotlight PA is co-presenting this event with Color &amp; Culture, a Pennsylvania marketing firm.

“The Path to Equity: Empowering Pennsylvanians through Democracy Initiatives” will focus on the state&#39;s rapidly growing communities of color, why they are not yet proportionally represented in positions of power, what obstacles exist in terms of their engagement, and the vital importance journalism plays in this equation. This is an important conversation at any time, but especially ahead of 2024 as a swing state.
