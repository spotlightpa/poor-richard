After a long and contentious election cycle that saw Pennsylvania become a bellwether for national policy debates, the votes are in. Near the top of the ballot, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-results-josh-shapiro-governor-analysis/" target="_blank">Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano to become the state’s 48th governor</a>, and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-day-2022-updates-voting-results-mastriano-shapiro-oz-fetterman/" target="_blank">Democrat John Fetterman won a U.S. Senate seat over Republican Mehmet Oz</a>.

Down the ballot, Democrats have <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-governor-election-2022-results-house-democrats-flip-republican-control/" target="_blank">won the state House</a> for the first time in more than a decade, and Republicans maintained control of the state Senate.

In 2023, these newly elected officials will shape education, environmental, health, and labor policies that affect all Pennsylvanians. To help you make sense of the election and give you a glimpse of what might lie ahead, Spotlight PA’s government team discussed the results and the policy plans the winners will prioritize after they are sworn in.
