HARRISBURG — A late-night fire at Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official state residence in Harrisburg on Sunday was caused by arson, according to the Pennsylvania State Police.

In a social media message, Shapiro said he and his family “woke up to bangs on the door from the Pennsylvania State Police after an arsonist set fire to the Governor’s Residence in Harrisburg.”

“The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was on the scene and while they worked to put out the fire, we were evacuated from the Residence safely by Pennsylvania State Police and assisted by Capitol Police,” he said. “Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished.”

In a separate statement, the State Police said the agency “is prepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson.” An investigation is ongoing.

“While the fire was successfully extinguished, it caused a significant amount of damage to a portion of the residence,” the agency said. “The Governor and his family were present in a different part of the residence. They were evacuated safely and were not injured.”

Shapiro said he and his wife, Lori, are “eternally grateful” to law enforcement and first responders “for keeping us safe.”
