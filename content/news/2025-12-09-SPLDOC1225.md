Spotlight PA is proud to announce the release of &#34;Unprotected: Inside PA&#39;s Broken System for Protecting Older Adults,&#34; a new mini-documentary examining failures to protect vulnerable Pennsylvanians from abuse and neglect, which can have devastating consequences.

Based on months of investigative reporting, the documentary reveals how for years, many of Pennsylvania&#39;s 52 county agencies responsible for protecting older adults failed to swiftly investigate complaints of suspected abuse or neglect — sometimes even in emergencies.

At the same time, far greater numbers of older Pennsylvanians have been dying with open abuse and neglect investigations. In 2023 alone, that number was more than 1,500 people.

&#34;Unprotected&#34; traces the meticulous work of Spotlight PA investigative reporter Angela Couloumbis as she tells the stories behind the statistics, including families who pleaded for help for months only to lose loved ones while bureaucratic delays and dysfunction left them waiting.

The documentary explores how state regulators rarely imposed sanctions on failing agencies, how critical data tracking deaths during investigations was quietly halted, and how whistleblowers inside the state government have been raising alarms for years.

&#34;Unprotected,&#34; voiced and produced by veteran investigative TV journalist Mitch Blacher, is part of Spotlight PA&#39;s ongoing commitment to independent, unbiased journalism that drives real change for Pennsylvanians. You can view the documentary above, or <a href="https://youtu.be/Se_8d5PzmMU"><strong>watch it at any time here</strong></a>.

In the coming months, Spotlight PA will be screening the documentary throughout the state.
