Spotlight PA is here to help you navigate the Pennsylvania election process — from important voting deadlines to candidate guides to [primers on election misinformation](https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/elections-101/). Our goal is that the resources on this page will give you the critical information you need to confidently cast your vote, and answer some questions you didn’t know you had in the process.

This November, voters across Pennsylvania will cast their ballots in statewide and national races. This includes presidential, congressional (U.S. House and Senate), row office (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and legislative elections. All of these positions hold tremendous power and responsibility, but it’s the statewide races that will have the most direct impact on Pennsylvanians and the ones you will find the most information about on this page.

We invite suggestions for new features for this page and encourage you to check back regularly for all your 2024 election needs. Read more about [how we’re covering the 2024 Pennsylvania election](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/01/pennsylvania-2024-election-coverage-president-senate-row-offices-pan/).
