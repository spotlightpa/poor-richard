    Journalism has been foundational to the success of American democracy. The long legacy of
    press freedom was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution here in Pennsylvania almost 250 years
    ago, and it is Spotlight PA’s mission to ensure that it continues to thrive throughout our
    Commonwealth. By adding a donation to Spotlight PA to your estate planning, known as a
    bequest, you can be a part of this legacy forever.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Please let us know if you are including Spotlight PA in your plans, so we can help ensure
    that you have the most up-to-date and accurate information necessary and that your donation
    will be used in the exact way that you wish. This will also allow us to plan ahead as an
    organization. Please contact Sean O’Riordan at <a href="mailto:soriordan@spotlightpa.org">soriordan@spotlightpa.org</a>.

<div class="mb-12 md:text-2xl md:leading-relaxed">
  <ul class="space-y-3">
    <li>
      <strong>Bequests</strong> – Designating that a portion of your estate will be distributed to one or more organizations in a charitable manner. This can be a flat sum, a percentage of your estate, etc. This is the most common and simplest form of planned giving.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Life Insurance</strong> – This is as simple as adding an organization as a beneficiary to your existing life insurance policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>IRA/Retirement Accounts</strong> – Much like with life insurance, you can add an organization as the beneficiary of your retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k).
    </li>
  </ul>
