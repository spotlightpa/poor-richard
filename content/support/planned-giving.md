{{<featured/large>}}Journalism has been foundational to the success of American democracy. The long legacy of press freedom was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution here in Pennsylvania almost 250 years ago, and it is Spotlight PA’s mission to ensure that it continues to thrive throughout our Commonwealth. By adding a donation to Spotlight PA to your estate planning, known as a bequest, you can be a part of this legacy forever.
<br><br>
Please let us know if you are including Spotlight PA in your plans, so we can help ensure that you have the most up-to-date and accurate information necessary and that your donation will be used in the exact way that you wish. This will also allow us to plan ahead as an organization. Please contact Sean O’Riordan at <a href="mailto:soriordan@spotlightpa.org">soriordan@spotlightpa.org</a>.

# What exactly is “Planned Giving?”

{{<featured/large>}}
“Planned Giving” is a term used in the nonprofit world to refer to donations made as a part of the estate planning process. A few common forms of planned giving are:{{</featured/large>}}

<ul class="md:text-2xl md:leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Bequests</strong> – Designating that a portion of your estate will be distributed to one or more organizations in a charitable manner. This can be a flat sum, a percentage of your estate, etc. This is the most common and simplest form of planned giving.</li>
  <li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> – This is as simple as adding an organization as a beneficiary to your existing life insurance policy.</li>
  <li><strong>IRA/Retirement Accounts</strong> – Much like with life insurance, you can add an organization as the beneficiary of your retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k).</li>
</ul>
