{{<testimonial-item author="Merrill and Nancy Brenner, Macungie, PA, Leaders in Action">}}
Pennsylvanians deserve better than having to rely on shrinking, vanishing, and increasingly biased media and unverified social media postings.  Spotlight PA fills this critical need for trusted investigations and reporting.  We are proud to support this essential organization that stays focused on its mission with unquestionable integrity, is run efficiently and effectively, and achieves results that bring positive changes for Pennsylvanians.{{</testimonial-item>}}

{{<testimonial-item author="Sharon Hyde, State College, PA, Leader in Action">}}
I support Spotlight PA because I believe it is important to have independent investigative journalists covering state and local government. Spotlight needs public support so that it can remain independent.{{</testimonial-item>}}

{{<testimonial-item author="Roger and Karen Klotz, Latrobe, PA, Leaders in Action">}}
We support Spotlight because we believe being informed citizens is essential for a democracy. Spotlight provides essential in-depth articles that my local papers no longer can supply independently.{{</testimonial-item>}}

{{<testimonial-item author="David Martens, York Dispatch, Leader in Action">}}
All Pennsylvanians interested in state government issues are very well served by Spotlight PA reporting teams. Their in-depth and timely reporting informs readers truthfully about statewide issues affecting daily life. Spotlight PA is a trustworthy news source in this era of misinformation and disinformation.{{</testimonial-item>}}
{{<testimonial-item author="Betsey Useem, Merion Station, PA, Leader in Action">}}
In an era where fraud and dishonesty among public officials (and their supporters) have become more frequent and blatant, it is critical to have a crusading press focused on exposing wrongdoing. This is especially true in Pennsylvania where regulations are lax or poorly enforced. The expertise and resources of Spotlight PA are essential to good government in this state.{{</testimonial-item>}}
