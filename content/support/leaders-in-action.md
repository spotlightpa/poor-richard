Leaders in Action are individual donors who are champions of Spotlight PA's mission at the highest level, contributing $1,000 or more annually to our newsroom. Leaders in Action help us to expand Spotlight PA's urgent investigative reporting, increase accessibility to quality, fact-based information for all Pennsylvanians, and advance our commitment to protecting democracy. Leaders in Action not only sustain—but directly advance—unique and vital reporting that drives change.
