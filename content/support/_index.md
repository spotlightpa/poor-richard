  {{<featured/large>}}Spotlight PA is a nonpartisan, independent newsroom paid for by grants from foundations and donations from individuals committed to robust investigative reporting. Spotlight PA editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over all of the content they produce. Funders do not have input into the selection of which stories Spotlight PA pursues or the reporting process for those stories. Funders do not review any content before publication or have any special access to reporters or newsroom leadership. In short, we answer to you, the public.{{</featured/large>}}

  {{<featured/large>}}Funds for Spotlight PA are donated to the nonprofit <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/" class="text-yellow">Lenfest Institute for Journalism</a>, which then directs them to our work. As part of our gift acceptance policy, and consistent with our promise to be fully transparent, we do not accept anonymous donations.{{</featured/large>}}
