Spotlight PA is a nonpartisan, independent newsroom paid for by grants from community foundations and individuals committed to robust investigative reporting. Now more than ever, the health of our state and democracy depends on strong accountability journalism. Our newsroom provides the time and resources necessary to do investigative work that drives change.

Spotlight PA editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over all of the content they produce. Funders do not have input into the selection of which stories Spotlight PA pursues or the reporting process for those stories. Funders do not review any content before publication. In short, we answer to you, the public.

All money for Spotlight PA is donated to the nonprofit [Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org), which serves as an extra buffer between our investigative newsroom and our funders. We do not accept anonymous donations.

The Philadelphia Inquirer provides in-kind fiscal and administrative support for all Spotlight PA employees, as well as salary and benefits for one full-time reporter. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News each provide a reporter including salary and benefits.

Continuing fundraising is intended to cover Spotlight PA's entire budget, including all in-kind contributions, making it a fully self-sustaining and growing organization.
