## Commitment to transparency

Spotlight PA is an unprecedented investigative news cooperative that combines the strengths of the state’s major news organizations, led by [The Philadelphia Inquirer][inky] in partnership with the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette][pg], [PennLive/The Patriot-News][pennlive] and [LNP Media Group][lnp] (Lancaster, PA). Our independent newsroom is grant-funded by community foundations and individuals committed to robust investigative reporting.

Spotlight PA editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over all Spotlight PA content. All money for Spotlight PA is donated to the non-profit [Lenfest Institute for Journalism][lenfest], which serves as an additional buffer between our investigative newsroom and our funders.
