Spotlight PA is a non-partisan, independent newsroom paid for by grants from community foundations and individuals committed to robust investigative reporting. Now more than ever, the health of our state and democracy depends on strong accountability journalism. Our newsroom provides the time and resources necessary to do impactful investigative work.

Spotlight PA editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over all of the content they produce. All money for Spotlight PA is donated to the non-profit [Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org), which serves as an additional buffer between our investigative newsroom and our funders.
