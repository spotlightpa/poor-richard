Spotlight PA is dedicated to producing non­partisan investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government and urgent statewide issues. We are an independent watchdog unafraid to dig deep, fight for the truth, and take on the powerful to expose wrongdoing and drive change.

This important work takes a lot of time and resources. Three newsrooms — led by The Philadelphia Inquirer, in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/The Patriot-News — are spearheading an unprecedented collaboration to reinvigorate accountability reporting on our state capital.

But we can't do it without your help.

Become a **Founding Donor** and support our team of seven highly talented investigative journalists as they track how your hard-earned tax dollars are spent, ensure the vulnerable and marginalized are protected, and demand answers from state officials and lawmakers about waste, fraud, and abuse.

Your tax-deductible donation will help us investigate one of the largest and most opaque state capitals in the U.S. and better inform you and your community.

Together, we can hold the powerful to account.
