Pennsylvania’s Nov. 5 election is fast approaching, and Pennsylvanians will soon have to decide which attorney general candidate to support.

The attorney general represents the interests of the state and the public, and defends Pennsylvania’s laws in court. The job has also served as a stepping stone for running for higher office in the commonwealth, including the governorship.

The major party candidates on the ballot this November are Democrat Eugene DePasquale and Republican Dave Sunday.

To help highlight the differences between the candidates, and show you which candidate you best align with, Spotlight PA has created this quick quiz.
