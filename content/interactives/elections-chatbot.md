### Why and how we built this

Spotlight PA is committed to supporting Pennsylvania voters with resources like candidate guides, voting guides, and coverage of critical election issues. Our 2025 Election Assistant is an experiment in using AI to answer thousands of unique reader questions that would otherwise be impossible for our team to address individually.

The tool searches published reporting by Spotlight PA and trusted resources from the Pennsylvania Department of State, then generates suggested questions and answers that are reviewed, edited, and fact-checked by our journalists. This experiment may not always understand your question or be able to come up with an answer, especially if the question falls outside our areas of reporting.  [Read our Editor’s Note](/news/2024/09/spotlight-pennsylvania-election-assistant-editors-note/) to learn more and [visit our feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyRZEabAGvm23xb5MbU9TiOYEZbkPklgG-WnpWZIlz1Cy9JA/viewform) to tell us about your experience.
