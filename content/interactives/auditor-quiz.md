Pennsylvania’s Nov. 5 election is fast approaching, and Pennsylvanians will soon have to decide which auditor general candidate to support.

The major party candidates on the ballot this November are [Democrat Malcolm Kenyatta](/news/2024/10/malcolm-kenyatta-pennsylvania-auditor-general-election-2024/) and [Republican incumbent Tim DeFoor](/news/2024/10/tim-defoor-pennsylvania-auditor-general-election-2024/).

To help highlight the differences between the candidates, and show you which candidate you best align with, Spotlight PA has created this quick quiz.
