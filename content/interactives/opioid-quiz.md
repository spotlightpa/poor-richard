  content = "&nbsp;\n\n  Hundreds of millions of dollars from opioid settlements have flowed into Pennsylvania to help the state respond to an epidemic that kills thousands of people each year — and even more money is expected in the years to come. But a powerful state oversight board has routinely blocked members of the public from having a meaningful say in how the money should be used.\n\n  Members of the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust regularly [meet in secret](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/06/pennsylvania-opioid-settlement-board-secret-meetings-lawmaker-challenge/) and have not allowed [public comment](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/08/opioid-settlement-cash-public-comments-ignored/) at their open meetings. The trust can withhold future funds if board members decide counties or other local governments spent money inappropriately — but there have been big disagreements and even some court cases over what counts [as inappropriate spending](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/11/pennsylvania-opioid-settlement-money-commonwealth-court-spending-lawsuits/).\n\n  There’s a lot at stake, as the state could receive [billions of dollars over many years](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/05/pa-opioid-settlement-money-explained/). Most of the money ultimately goes to the state’s 67 counties, and their approaches to transparency and public input vary. The spending decisions they and the state’s oversight board make have far-reaching consequences, and those choices have already prompted conflicts over law enforcement spending, programs related to children and families, and money for residents of a Philadelphia neighborhood.\n\n  To help people better understand the debates over these choices and their impact, Spotlight PA has created this interactive tool. Step into the role of a decision-maker and see how settlement outcomes might change if you were in charge.\n  "
