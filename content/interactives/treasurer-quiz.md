Pennsylvania’s Nov. 5 election is fast approaching, and Pennsylvanians will soon have to decide which treasurer candidate to support.

The major party candidates on the ballot this November are [Democrat Erin McClelland](/news/2024/10/erin-mcclelland-pennsylvania-treasurer-election-2024/) and [Republican incumbent Stacy Garrity](/news/2024/10/stacy-garrity-pennsylvania-treasurer-election-2024/).

To help highlight the differences between the candidates, and show you which candidate you best align with, Spotlight PA has created this quiz. It was informed by a candidate questionnaire both campaigns filled out. See [McClelland’s here](https://www.scribd.com/document/775612454/Erin-McClelland-Spotlight-PA-Candidate-Questionnaire-2024-General-Election) and [Garrity’s here](https://www.scribd.com/document/775611511/Stacy-Garrity-Spotlight-PA-Candidate-Questionnaire-2024-General-Election).
