Pennsylvania's general election is on the horizon, and the school board in Oley Valley, which has made headlines for some members' controversial and extreme views, is poised for a shake-up.

Six of nine board seats are up for grabs on Nov. 4, with just two incumbents --- Andrew Kline and Zachary Moore --- on the ballot. They are joined by Jeff Boyd, Donald Haas, Jodie Kline, Darrell Markley, Gary Wegman, and Brian Weidner.

All voters can participate in this election. [Learn more about the candidates here](/berks/2025/09/pennsylvania-election-oley-valley-school-board-candidate-guide-election/).

Spotlight PA Berks Bureau created this quiz to help you figure out which candidates share your ideals and approach to public education. Nearly all of the contenders for office who spoke with Spotlight PA agreed they wanted to move away from the conflict that prevented the board from getting things done. Those who spoke with Spotlight PA said ensuring adequate revenue sources in the face of budget constraints is also a top priority.

Boyd and Weidner did not respond to Spotlight PA requests. Weidner has a [candidate website](https://brianweidnerforoley.wixsite.com/bw4ovsb) from which a response is quoted.
