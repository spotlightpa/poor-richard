Pennsylvania’s Nov. 5 election is fast approaching, and Pennsylvanians will soon have to decide which <a href="/news/2024/09/pennsylvania-election-2024-attorney-general-candidates-eugene-depasquale-dave-sunday/">attorney general</a>, <a href="/news/2024/09/pennsylvania-election-2024-auditor-general-candidates-tim-defoor-malcolm-kenyatta/">auditor general</a>, and <a href="/news/2024/09/pennsylvania-election-2024-treasurer-candidates-stacy-garrity-erin-mcclelland/">treasurer</a> candidates to support. 

To help highlight the differences between the candidates, and show you which ones you best align with, Spotlight PA has created three quizzes — one for each race.
