Spotlight PA is dedicated to producing non­partisan investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government and urgent statewide issues. We are an independent watchdog unafraid to dig deep, fight for the truth and take on the powerful to expose wrongdoing and spur meaningful reform. We connect Pennsylvanians to their state, and to each other, through public service journalism that matters to their lives and is creatively told in the many modern, digital ways they consume their news.

Our collaborative newsroom is powered by the [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com), [Pittsburgh Post­-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com) and [PennLive/The Patriot-News](http://www.pennlive.com). Additional partners — including [PA Post](www.papost.org), a project of [WITF](www.witf.org), and [LNP Media Group](https://lnpmediagroup.com)/[The Caucus](https://caucuspa.com/) — allow us to share resources and maximize audience and reporting power for the public. We continue to seek new distribution partners to join our initial group. For more information on how to become a partner, [please contact us](/contact/).

Spotlight PA strives to serve as a collaborator and resource to all newsrooms in the state to help uncover and enhance stories of statewide importance that otherwise would go unnoticed or untold. We pursue investigations with the potential for meaningful, real­-world change, and that’s the sole measure of our success.

Investigative reporting takes time, money and dedicated journalists. Unfortunately, aggressive reporting on Pennsylvania’s state government has withered as newsrooms have faced financial pressure and cut back on coverage. With the [support of donors and readers](http://www.spotlightpa.org/support/), like you, Spotlight PA fills that void in a bold way, deploying a team of talented journalists with a diverse set of skills and experiences to investigate one of the largest and most opaque state capitals in the U.S.
