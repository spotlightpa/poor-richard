## PennLive & The Patriot-News join Spotlight PA as founding partners

_Unprecedented collaboration with The Philadelphia Inquirer and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette will power Pennsylvania's largest newsroom dedicated to covering PA government._

HARRISBURG (Aug. 29, 2019) – [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org), an independent, nonpartisan news organization, today announced the addition of [PennLive and The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com) as founding partners.

[PennLive and The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com) join [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com) and [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com) in an unprecedented collaboration to expand investigative and public-service journalism in Pennsylvania.

“Watchdog reporting on state government is an extremely high priority for our readers. They’re especially interested in knowing how their tax money is being spent,” said Cate Barron, president of PA Media Group, parent company of PennLive and The Patriot-News. “Our partnership promises to add major muscle to this kind of coverage at the Capitol and throughout the state.”

[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org)’s team of a dozen, including eight reporters recruited from across the U.S., will form the largest newsroom in Pennsylvania dedicated solely to covering state government and urgent statewide issues. Its mission is to hold powerful public and private forces — especially governments, businesses and special interests — to account through journalism that drives change.

In addition to joining [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org), the PennLive/Patriot-News newsroom will continue the award-winning work of its three-person Capitol bureau.

“PennLive/Patriot-News and Advance Local routinely produce award-winning investigative journalism,” said Christopher Baxter, editor in chief of [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org). “They recognize the value of high-quality reporting and the resources it takes to produce, and they are skilled at delivering that work to a digital audience. With their help, Spotlight PA will become an indispensable resource for our state.”

“We think Spotlight is an exciting example of our industry bound by shared journalistic values and coming together in new ways to make a difference – in this case for our readers and all residents of the Commonwealth. We are thrilled to be a partner,” said Tim Kennedy, regional president for Advance Local.

[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org) is a grant-funded newsroom supported by a [coalition of national and local funders, as well as individuals](http://www.spotlightpa.org/support), who value accountability reporting from the capital and the need to connect residents with the important decisions made there. Those interested in supporting the newsroom can [become a Founding Donor to Spotlight PA now](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate).

“[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org) is a uniquely powerful public-service news partnership, combining the strength of several major news organizations with the agility of a start-up,” said Jim Friedlich, CEO of [The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org), the non-profit owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer and a lead funder of [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org). “We believe this approach will have significant impact not only in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania but in state capitals across the country.”

Each of the founding partners is contributing a full-time reporter to [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org) as well as other financial and fundraising support to help put the news organization on a path to becoming a permanent, self-sustaining fixture in the state.

“These three news organizations have a strong track record for producing difference-making journalism,” said Stan Wischnowski, executive editor and senior vice president of The Philadelphia Inquirer. “In just the past seven years, they’ve collectively won four Pulitzer Prizes and had multiple Pulitzer finalists. There’s such a tremendous need for more accountability journalism like this at this critical juncture for our industry and our democracy.”

"Spotlight PA represents what may become a new and exciting model for journalism — all digital, nimble, totally collaborative, and laser focused,” said Keith Burris, executive editor of the Post-Gazette. “It also represents a significant initiative in Pennsylvania journalism — in informing our fellow citizens. Spotlight will shine a light on some dark and dubious places, in Harrisburg and beyond, and the Commonwealth will be better for it."

The high-quality journalism produced by [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org) will appear on spotlightpa.org and across the many platforms offered by the three founding partners, which reach in excess of 15 million unique visitors a month. Additional partners include [PA Post](https://www.papost.org), a nonprofit newsroom launched last year by central Pennsylvania’s public radio station, [WITF](https://www.witf.org), as well as [The Caucus](https://caucuspa.com/), a publication of the [LNP Media Group](https://www.lancasteronline.com) in Lancaster.
