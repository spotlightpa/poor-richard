## Have questions about the 2024 election in PA? Ask our AI-powered assistant and get a trusted answer based on Spotlight PA’s election coverage and resources from the PA Department of State.

The election assistant is trained to provide answers related to Spotlight PA’s 2024 election coverage, which focuses on the state Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer races with some high level coverage of the US Senate, US House, and PA General Assembly races. The tool also covers many aspects of voting administration, including where to vote and how to vote. Generally speaking, the tool will not be able to answer questions about a specific address or zip code, and it will not be able to evaluate candidates based on a set of criteria. If you don’t get the answer you need here, please reach out to our team at [elections@spotlightpa.org](mailto:elections@spotlightpa.org) and we’ll do our best to point you in the right direction.
