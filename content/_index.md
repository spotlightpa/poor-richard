{{<content-header>}}Journalism powered by you{{</content-header>}}

Our reporters serve as independent watchdogs unafraid to dig deep, fight for the truth and take on the powerful to expose wrongdoing and spur reform. _**But we can’t do it without your help.**_ The most important investigations start with a tip from readers like you. Together, we can hold the powerful to account.

{{<content-header>}}Commitment to transparency{{</content-header>}}

Spotlight PA is a nonpartisan, grant-funded newsroom supported by [The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org) and more than a dozen other community foundations and individuals. We continue to grow our support while ensuring our newsroom and journalists retain total independence and editorial control, free to pursue the stories that matter most to Pennsylvanians.
