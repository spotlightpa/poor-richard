Spotlight PA is a collaborative newsroom dedicated to producing investigative journalism for all of Pennsylvania. Spotlight PA’s mission is to hold powerful private and public forces — especially governments, businesses and special interests — to account through urgent and compelling investigative journalism that drives change.

Spotlight PA combines the strengths of [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com), [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com) and [PennLive/The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com) in a historic commitment to investigative reporting on state government and beyond. Additional partners — including [PA Post](https://papost.org), a project of [WITF](http://www.witf.org), and [LNP Media Group](https://lnpmediagroup.com)/[The Caucus](https://caucuspa.com/) — allow us to share resources and maximize audience and reporting power. We intend to provide our content **free of charge** to newsrooms across the state to help bolster local media and better inform the public.

{{<content-header>}}Journalism powered by you{{</content-header>}}

Our reporters serve as independent watchdogs unafraid to dig deep, fight for the truth and take on the powerful to expose wrongdoing and spur reform. **_But we can’t do it without your help._** The most important investigations start with a tip from readers like you. Together, we can hold the powerful to account.

{{<content-header>}}Commitment to transparency{{</content-header>}}

Spotlight PA is a nonpartisan, grant-funded newsroom supported by [The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org) and more than a dozen other community foundations and individuals. We continue to grow our support while ensuring our newsroom and journalists retain total independence and editorial control, free to pursue the stories that matter most to Pennsylvanians.
