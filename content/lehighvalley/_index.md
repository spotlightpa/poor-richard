Amid the decline of legacy media in the region, Spotlight PA is exploring the creation of a potential new community newsroom in the Lehigh Valley. This newsroom would produce investigative and public-service journalism about topics of civic importance to Lehigh, Northampton, and Carbon counties.

Spotlight PA is currently assessing information needs in the Lehigh Valley and studying feasibility for a community newsroom through conducting listening sessions and research, exploring content distribution methods, and developing the local newsroom strategy with the input and direction of local voices. Thanks to a private donation, Spotlight PA contracted Megan Beste of Taggart Associates to lead the planning process over six months in 2025.

Interested in learning more? Contact Megan Beste, Lehigh Valley Project Lead, at [megan@spotlightpa.org](megan@spotlightpa.org)."""

copy = """Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom dedicated to high-quality investigative and public-service journalism about the Pennsylvania state government and urgent statewide issues. Spotlight PA was founded to address a crisis in journalism in Pennsylvania: the ongoing and rapid decline of corporate-owned legacy news outlets, which is greatly diminishing access to trusted, contextual, and factual reporting across the state. With support from foundations, individuals, and more, Spotlight PA is uncovering stories that would otherwise go untold and cutting through partisanship and misinformation to deliver trusted, reliable journalism at no cost to all in Pennsylvania. Since its inception in 2019, Spotlight PA has become a leading national model for independent, collaborative journalism that empowers residents and gets results. Its work has won numerous state and national awards and driven meaningful change and policy reforms in the state capital and beyond."""
