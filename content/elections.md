As Pennsylvania gears up for the pivotal 2022 election, Spotlight PA wants to empower voters to make an informed decision on Nov. 8. Specifically, we’ll focus our reporting resources on where candidates stand on the issues, how the voting process works, and how to get involved.

As part of that, our election series — [“One Vote, Two Pennsylvanias”](/series/one-vote-two-pennsylvanias/) — will clearly articulate through policy proposals and issue-based reporting the vastly different visions the candidates for governor have for the future of our state. You can find links to that coverage below, with new stories publishing regularly.

Our new Election Center also features a voter toolbox with key dates, an interactive sample ballot, a campaign finance tracker, and a form to get in contact with our reporters. We invite <a href="mailto:shughes@spotlightpa.org">suggestions for new features</a> for this page, or you can <a href="/news/2022/09/pa-election-2022-mastriano-shapiro-governor-our-coverage-explainer/">read more about how we’re covering the 2022 Pennsylvania election.</a>
