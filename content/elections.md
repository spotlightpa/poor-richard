Spotlight PA is here to help you navigate the Pennsylvania election process — from important voting deadlines to the different ways to cast a ballot to explainers on relevant legal rulings and how they affect you. Our goal is that the resources on this page will give you the critical information you need to confidently cast your vote, and answer some questions you didn’t know you had in the process.

This May, Democrats and Republicans across Pennsylvania will cast their ballots in municipal races. Depending on where you live, your ballot could include races for mayor, school board, city council, various judicial offices, district attorney, and more. While we’re not able to cover the thousands of municipal races on the ballot this year, we’ll have voter guides, including one to help you vet candidates, along with some coverage on select local races in Berks County and the State College area. 

We invite suggestions for new features for this page and encourage you to check back regularly for all your 2025 election needs. Read more about how we’re covering the 2025 Pennsylvania election.
