COMMONWEALTH COURT, SUPREME COURT || ABORTION

Case: Allegheny Reproductive Health Center v. Pennsylvania Department of Human Services

Summary: A group of abortion providers is suing the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to challenge a law, passed in 1982, that prevents the state from using public dollars to cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person. 

Commonwealth Court ruled against the petitioners in March 2021, saying it was bound by a 1985 state Supreme Court decision that found the 1982 law was constitutional. 

The petitioners appealed to the state Supreme Court, which accepted the case and heard oral arguments in November 2022. A final ruling is still pending as of August 2023.

Case: Firearm Owners Against Crime v. City of Pittsburgh

Summary: Firearms Owners Against Crime sued the City of Pittsburgh after its City Council passed three firearms ordinances in April 2019. The regulations were in response to the shooting at the Tree of Synagogue in 2018 that killed 11 people.

The ordinances banned assault weapons in public places, would punish gun owners whose storage practices resulted in a minor causing harm with a gun, and permitted family members and law enforcement to seek court intervention if they believed a person to be dangerous.

The group filed suit the day the bills were signed into law, arguing that Pennsylvania’s Uniform Firearms Act prohibits the city from enacting any gun restrictions. 
[mention common pleas?]

In May 2022, Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court agreed with group, citing a section of that Act that reads: “No county, municipality or township may in any manner regulate the lawful ownership, possession, transfer or transportation of firearms, ammunition or ammunition components when carried or transported for purposes not prohibited by the laws of this Commonwealth.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said the city intends to appeal the decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

SUPREME COURT || CIVIL LIBERTIES

Case: Gov. Tom Wolf v. Sen. Joseph Scarnati, Sen. Jake Corman, and Senate Republican Caucus

Summary: 

In July 2020, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-19 emergency declaration, ruling that the attempt to overturn it by the Republican-controlled Legislature was unconstitutional and that Wolf was acting within his executive authority.

Typically, this case would have gone through the Commonwealth Court first, but the Wolf administration, in search of a speedy resolution, asked the Supreme Court to exercise its “King’s Bench power.” This unique law allows the Supreme Court the jurisdiction to review any case with “immediate public importance.” The Supreme Court granted this request.

In the ruling, Justice David Wecht emphasized that the decision wasn’t about the governor’s response to the pandemic, but rather about the importance of balance in power between branches of government, “a balance that prevents one branch from dominating the others.”

Case: Friends of Danny Devito v. Gov. Tom Wolf

Summary:

May 2020

The Supreme Court sided with Gov. Tom Wolf again in May 2020, keeping the governor’s COVID-19 Executive Order to close all “non-life sustaining” businesses in place. The lawsuit was brought forth by the campaign of local state Rep. candidate Danny DeVito and other Pennsylvania businesses, who argued their constitutional rights were being violated by the orders.

The court exercised its “King’s Bench jurisdiction" and ruled that the petitioners were “not entitled to relief.”

In 2023, Pennsylvania voters statewide will be asked to pick a new state Supreme Court justice as well as judges to sit on Superior and Commonwealth courts. These appellate courts set down highly consequential decisions about elections, school funding, and more.

Further down the ballot are more judicial contests as well as municipal races for local officials and school board members. These elected officials have regular, close contact with communities and can use that power for good (and bad).

Spotlight PA is focusing its nonpartisan reporting resources on the May 16 primary election this year, in addition to the Nov. 7 general election. That’s because, in some parts of the state, voter registration is so dominated by one major party that the primary essentially serves as the general — with the eventual victor effectively decided in the spring.

Regardless of your political affiliation, trusted election reporting is the bedrock of an informed electorate and an informed vote.

On this page you will find key dates, guides to the races, and more. We <a href="mailto:shughes@spotlightpa.org">invite suggestions</a> for new features for this page, or you can <a href="/news/2023/03/pa-primary-election-2023-spotlight-pa-coverage/">read more about how we’re covering the 2023 Pennsylvania primary election</a>.
