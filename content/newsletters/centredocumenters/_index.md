**Centre Documenters** recruits, trains, and pays local citizen Documenters to attend and document meetings in six under-covered townships across Centre County.

Documenters seeks to increase access to information presented and decisions being made at local public meetings. This information is provided to local residents and media organizations through our twice-monthly newsletter, our texting service, and our website.

**Centre Documenters** is powered by the News Lab at Penn State and Spotlight PA.

Sign up for the Centre Documenters newsletter, which is free and delivered straight to your inbox on the first and third Monday of every month.
