Our reporters rely on readers like you to alert us to waste, fraud, abuse or other problems involving state or local government, businesses or individuals. The best tips are specific (with details we can use to guide our reporting) and newsworthy (affecting a large number of people or involving entities or individuals with power over a large number of people).

_PLEASE NOTE: The communication channels below are intended only for news tips to our reporters. For technical problems, please email [webmaster@spotlightpa.org](mailto:webmaster@spotlightpa.org). For general comments, please use [the form below](#general-inquiries). Other submissions, including press releases or events, will not receive a response._

## Email

Submit a tip using your regular email service. For more secure email options, see below.

**Email us**: [tips@spotlightpa.org](mailto:tips@spotlightpa.org)

## Phone/text

Our tip line can be reached at any time by phone or text message. Leave a detailed voicemail describing the tip and any information that would help us in our reporting including names, dates, locations, where we might find relevant documents, who we should contact for more information, and so on. If you’re willing, please leave contact information should a reporter want to follow up with you. If you’re concerned about anonymity, consider calling from a pay phone or using a prepaid "burner" phone purchased with cash.

**Call us**: +1 717-418-9684

## Postal Mail

Snail mail remains one of the most secure ways of sending us information. We’ll have an address for you soon.

## Signal

Signal is a free app with end-to-end encryption, meaning the content of messages and calls can only be read by you or your intended recipient. You must register a phone number to begin using the app, so if you want to protect your identity, consider the same steps listed above in terms of using a “burner” phone. You must add our number to your contacts before messaging, so use a fake name for the entry, and we'll do the same.

**Add us**: +1 717-418-9684

## Protonmail

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/about) is an email service that allows users to send encrypted messages back and forth with one another. This operates much like other email services but encrypts message contents. Sign up requires a username and password, so don't use any identifying information. Once you have an account, you can communicate with us.

**Write us**: [spotlightpa@protonmail.com](mailto:spotlightpa@protonmail.com)
