Local governments, private businesses, and colleges in Berks County are among those seeking more than $92 million collectively from the state to help fund projects they say will benefit the community.

Hundreds of projects across the commonwealth are vying for Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) grants. While the legislature authorizes how much will be spent annually through the program, the governor has final approval over who gets a grant.

Over the years, the program has been criticized for its lack of openness and transparency, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/students/research/research-papers/does-pennsylvanias-redevelopment-assistance-capital-program">disproportionate funding</a> to certain communities, and minimal job creation. <a href="https://www.paauditor.gov/wp-content/uploads/audits-archive/Media/Default/Reports/speRACP062712.pdf">State audits</a> have called for increased oversight of the process and the hundreds of millions of dollars doled out through the program.

The money is supposed to be used for projects that have a cultural, regional, or multi-jurisdictional impact and generate increases or maintain current levels of employment, tax revenues, or other economic measures.

Applicants must be able to <a href="https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/budget/documents/programs-and-services/racp/racp-presentations/racp%20at%20a%20glance.pdf">match 50% of the total project costs</a>, and the project cannot be completed when the application is submitted. Project proposals also cannot be located in a City Revitalization and Improvement Zone (CRIZ), like in the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/09/reading-pennsylvania-downtown-development-criz-tax-zone-economy/">city of Reading</a>.

The Office of the Budget is <a href="https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/budget/documents/programs-and-services/racp/racp-main/racp%20public%20comment%20period.pdf">taking comments until Oct. 30</a> on the projects proposed for grant funding. Comments can be sent to <a href="mailto:RA-OB-PublicComment@pa.gov">RA-OB-PublicComment@pa.gov</a>.
