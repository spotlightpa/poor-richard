This week’s Community Spotlight honoree is Faith Bentz, 22, a product development engineer at Brentwood Industries, Inc., who founded a chapter of the Society of Women Engineers at Alvernia University.

This conversation took place by email and was lightly edited.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

<strong>Faith Bentz:</strong> I live in Shillington.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I am fortunate to have a loving and supportive family, including my parents and sister, who is a junior at Penn State Berks.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what you like about it.</strong>

I work at Brentwood Industries, Inc. as a product development engineer. I interned at Brentwood during my senior year at Alvernia University, and the internship transitioned into a full-time position. I am only in the beginning of my career, but have had a great experience so far. I love helping the team in the design and development of products and learning from their expertise. I also enjoy going back to Alvernia to speak with students about opportunities in the manufacturing and engineering fields.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

I was part of the first graduating class of engineers at Alvernia. This class of 12 had just two females. Being part of a brand-new program was a risk, but it has paid off for my classmates and me. Being in a male-dominated field also comes with challenges, but having support from those in my professional and personal life makes all the difference.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County.</strong>

There are so many! But if I had to pick one, it would be getting ice cream at Scoupe deVille in Birdsboro on a summer night. So many flavors to choose from, and it’s a fun atmosphere.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to in Berks?</strong>

I would take them on a walk or hike on one of the many trails in Berks because of how beautiful they are. Places like French Creek State Park, Nolde Forest, the Pinnacle/Pulpit Rock, Gring’s Mill, and Blue Marsh (just to name a few) offer such immersive experiences to be in nature.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

I started reading the Bible in college with a campus ministry, and it has answered so many of my questions.

<strong>Who has had the greatest influence in your life?</strong>

My parents have had a great influence on my life. It’s easy to look up to them in how they give their time back to the community. In addition to their careers, my dad is a volunteer firefighter, and my mom serves on Shillington’s borough council. Their dedication to building the community influences me to want to give back.
