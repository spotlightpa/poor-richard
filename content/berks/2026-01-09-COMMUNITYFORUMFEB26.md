Berks County's workforce is projected to grow slowly over the next five years. With many workers retiring, businesses will need to shift focus to recruiting younger talent and upskilling current staff to keep pace with workplace changes.

Join us to learn more about the future workforce as forecast in the Berks County Workforce 2030 plan and meet the new Workforce Development Board's new director, Amber Columbo.

This is a free virtual event on Feb. 19, 2026 at 11:30 a.m.
