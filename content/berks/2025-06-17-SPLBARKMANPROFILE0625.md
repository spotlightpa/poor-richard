This week&#39;s Community Spotlight honoree is Jen Barkman, a 36-year-old Realtor who volunteers as campaign coordinator for the Help A Girl Out drive address period poverty, an overlooked global community health dilemma in which women lack sufficient access, often due to costs, to menstrual products, education, and sanitation facilities.

Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Barkman: Mohrsville, Pennsylvania.

<strong>Tell us about your family.</strong>

I&#39;ve been blessed with a beautiful daughter who motivates me to always do my best and a husband who truly is my best friend. We also have a small zoo of four-legged friends who keep our lives entertaining.

<strong>Tell us about your job and what you like about it.</strong>

I’m going on five years as a Realtor and proudly work with Coldwell Banker Realty in Wyomissing. I truly love making a difference in people’s lives — whether it’s helping someone find their dream home or offering support through community work. My biggest volunteer commitment has been serving as the regional campaign coordinator for the Help A Girl Out drive for period poverty, where I’ve had the privilege of standing alongside Suzanne Cody of MG-Architects as we’ve expanded the initiative. I also serve as the community outreach vice-chair for the Reading-Berks Association of Realtors, working with local nonprofits to organize events and collection drives. For the past two years, I’ve been a committee member for Habitat for Humanity’s Birdhouse Challenge, which is a creative and impactful way to support affordable housing. Giving back is something I’m deeply passionate about, and I’m grateful for the chance to use both my career and volunteer work to make a positive impact.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

The biggest challenge I’ve faced was undergoing emergency surgery to remove a ruptured mass in my brain when I was just 21. It was a life-altering experience that forced me to leave school and completely change the plans I had made for my future. At the time, it was incredibly difficult to accept such a major detour, but I’m a true believer that everything happens for a reason. That experience taught me resilience, gratitude, and how to adapt when life throws you the unexpected. It ultimately led me down a new path—one that brought me to where I truly belong today, both personally and professionally.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County and why?</strong>

Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Berks is Shirley’s Café. Their menu is perfect whether I’m grabbing a quick, small lunch or sitting down to celebrate something special with family. The atmosphere is welcoming, the food is great, and you can&#39;t not mention their margaritas!

<strong>Where would you take a visitor in Berks and why?</strong>

If someone came to visit me, I’d definitely take them to the Reading Museum and Planetarium. It’s one of my favorite local spots—the trails around the museum are peaceful and relaxing. The exhibits inside are always fun to explore, and the shows at the planetarium are both educational and really enjoyable. It’s a great way to experience a mix of nature and culture.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

&#34;Water for Elephants&#34; has always been my favorite book. I love how it blends historical fiction with emotion, adventure, and human resilience. It also holds a special place in my heart because it was something my husband and I discovered we had in common on our very first date. It’s his favorite book too!

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you?</strong>

My mom, of course! It really wasn’t until I became a mom myself that I fully understood everything she did for me. She worked 12-hour shifts to pay for things like my braces, stayed up all night working and still showed up to every band concert, and was always protective—even when I didn’t understand it at the time. But what has influenced me the most is her strength. She’s been fighting stage 3 breast cancer, and she’s doing it with so much determination. Watching her face this challenge head-on without giving up has shown me what true resilience looks like. She’s one of the strongest people I know, and I’m proud to be her daughter.
