This week’s Community Spotlight honoree is Stuart Wells, 66, a semi-retired writer and historian drawn to community volunteer work.

This conversation, which took place over email, has been edited for length and style.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

<strong>Stuart Wells:</strong> Birdsboro.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I live with my wife and two sons (ages 23 and 16) in a home that never lies dormant and where the stove seemingly never cools off.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what you like about it.</strong>

I’m proud to have helped conceive and launch Mission Trip Birdsboro, which grew into its own nonprofit organization called <a href="https://www.missiontripbirdsboro.org/">Mission Trip Birdsboro and Beyond</a>. I continue to support its mission of serving neighbors in need. At St. Paul’s United Church of Christ in Birdsboro, I’m part of a small team developing Birdsboro Shares, a new mutual aid network where community members can freely share resources and skills. I’m also active with the Friends of the Schuylkill Navigation, working to preserve the history of the 200-year-old canal system.

I believe that striving to be a positive force in your community is important. Many people want to help but aren’t sure how to get involved. Uncertainty, social restraints, or fear can hold us back. Ministries like Mission Trip Birdsboro create space for people to join together — regardless of background or belief — to serve in ways that reflect Christ-like love and kindness. These efforts not only help those in need but also strengthen the spirits of those who give.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

Right now, my biggest challenge is helping to build Birdsboro Shares. None of us has prior experience creating a mutual aid network, yet we’re doing it anyway. We’re figuring it out, and we’re making progress. Mutual aid networks are about neighbors helping neighbors: sharing resources, offering and receiving freely, and forming a community network that facilitates communication and exchange. Our goal is to provide a contact point where people can ask for or offer something of value. We hope to launch within the coming year.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to in Berks and why?</strong>

I’m an outdoorsy person, and Berks County has an incredible selection of parks, preserves, game lands, and trails. I’m always eager to get into the woods and often take visitors hiking.

<strong>Is there a book, poem, or piece of art that speaks to you?</strong>

The arts have always been important to me — I studied art as an undergraduate and listen to music daily. I’m drawn to songs that carry hope and meaning, such as “Soulshine” covered by Gov’t Mule or the traditional gospel hymn “Amazing Grace.”

<strong>Who has had the greatest influence on your life?</strong>

I can’t point to just one person. At different times, close friends and even small, quiet encounters have helped redirect my life in meaningful ways. I’m grateful for all those influences, both large and subtle, that shaped who I am today.
