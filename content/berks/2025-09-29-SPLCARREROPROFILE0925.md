This week’s Community Spotlight honoree is Antonio J. Carrero, 41, who serves as program assistant manager at New Journey Community Outreach (NJCO) in Reading.

This conversation, which took place in person, has been edited for length and clarity.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

<strong>Antonio Carrero:</strong> I live in Reading.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I was born in Reading and lived here until I was 11, when I entered foster care near Harrisburg. My foster parents worked with deaf children, so I learned sign language early on. They were wonderful people, and I’m still close with two of my foster brothers.

I returned to Reading at 17. Today, my wife Selena and I share a beautiful, blended family of eight children, ranging in age from 7 to 26. I also carry the memory of my son, Antonio J. Carrero Jr., who tragically lost his life to gun violence in Reading about a year and a half ago.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what it means to you.</strong>

I absolutely love what I do. I volunteered at New Journey Community Outreach for 14 years before stepping into my current full-time role. As program assistant manager, I spend most mornings in the kitchen, starting around 6 a.m. I prepare meals and connect with the men who come through our doors. I see myself as a mentor, paying forward the guidance I once received there.

For me, cooking is more than a job; it’s a love language. My wife comes to work to help me when we’re making something special, like lasagna. With Puerto Rican and Italian roots, I’ve got a wide culinary range, and I pour my heart into every dish.

<strong>Can you share a challenge you&#39;ve faced?</strong>

I’ve faced many. I struggled with heroin addiction for years, but I’ve been clean now for 12. During that time, I was hospitalized for six months with endocarditis, a serious heart condition. That was a turning point.

Losing my son was another devastating blow. Gun violence in our city is a crisis that needs urgent attention. Through it all, I’ve been blessed with people who stood by me. New Journey was always a safe haven, and Jeff Laylon, our program director, played a huge role in helping me get into rehab. He’s been a true friend.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County?</strong>

Texas Roadhouse. Great food, big menu—something for everyone.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor in Berks?</strong>

The Pagoda, hands down. The view from up there is breathtaking.

<strong>Is there a book, poem, or piece of art that speaks to you?</strong>

The Bible is my foundation. I also enjoy motivational books and speakers. Psalms 23, “The Lord is my Shepherd,” is my favorite poem. And when it comes to movies, “Rocky” is my go-to. It’s all about perseverance.

<strong>Who has had the greatest influence on your life?</strong>

My wife, Selena. She’s my rock. She believes in me, pushes me to be better, and keeps me moving forward.
