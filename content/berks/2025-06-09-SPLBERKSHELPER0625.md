This week&#39;s inaugural Community Spotlight honoree is Florence “Flo” Pagan, a cook and kitchen manager at Opportunity House, an emergency shelter that&#39;s been helping Reading&#39;s homeless population since 1984.

Pagan told us about kitchen creativity, that time she cooked for over 85 people using just the bare essentials, and her Berks County favorites.

<em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.</em>

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Pagan: Reading, Pennsylvania.

<strong>Tell us about your family.</strong>

Daughter, Jeanette, her fiancé, Eric, and grandchildren Phanlon, 5, and Fennec, 1. I have six sisters who are my best friends.

<strong>Tell us about your job and what you like about it.</strong>

I am the cook and kitchen manager at Opportunity House. I love what I do. I get to be very creative with what we have on hand—what’s donated by cooking groups or through Helping Harvest.

My coworkers and clients are my family and make me feel so appreciated every day. I know that when I provide a meal for our clients, I can feel the love, gratitude, and thanks they give me. They are so very special to me. The amazing volunteers I’ve met who have a passion for providing a meal and friendship has been very rewarding.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

During the kitchen renovations I cooked for two months without a real kitchen. I cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner for over 85 people using just a microwave, toaster oven, tabletop burner, and air fryer.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County and why?</strong>

Austin’s. Excellent service, high quality food, and a consistent menu.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor in Berks and why?</strong>

The Pagoda. That’s what we’re known for. I’d also take them to West Reading to explore the great stores and restaurants. There’s always something good going on there.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

&#34;Imagine&#34; by John Lennon. The song is meaningful and has a great message. &#34;Smile&#34; by Nat King Cole. That song always makes me smile if I am sad.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you?</strong>

My mother. She was an outstanding cook, and I have fond memories of us working together in our family restaurant.
