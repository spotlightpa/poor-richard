The Kutztown Area School District <a href="https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1750854454/kasdorg/nvf2llgd2b7jzqkwb39c/FinalBudget2025-26.pdf">approved a $38.1 million budget</a> on June 23 after <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/voters-in-kutztown-area-school-district-overwhelmingly-reject-more-than-10-property-tax-hike/article_59572cea-95d3-4d82-b547-394d8834a5fb.html">residents overwhelmingly voted down a referendum</a> in May that would have hiked taxes more than 10% across the district.

Kutztown in May outlined its financial position, highlighting that major factors driving higher costs were increases in salaries and benefits, decreased property tax assessments, rising cyber charter tuition costs, reduced state funding, and nine years without a school tax increase.

School board members ultimately approved a 4% property tax increase, bringing the millage rate to 32.2428 mills.
