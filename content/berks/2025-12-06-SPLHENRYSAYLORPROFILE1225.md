This week’s Community Spotlight honorees are Alexis Henry and Valerie Sayler, friends who recently initiated an online food drive with the goal of donating funds for fresh fruits and vegetables to Helping Harvest.

This conversation, which took place by email, has been edited for length and style.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Valerie Sayler: Sinking Spring.

Alexis Henry: West Reading.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

Val lives with her husband, Geoff, and their two children, Clara and Cash.

Alexis grew up with her parents and brother, Jack, surrounded by a large, extended Irish family that included her grandparents and dozens of aunts, uncles, and cousins.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what you like about it.</strong>

Alexis, who is a professional recruiter, began volunteering for a food bank as a student at West Chester University. She enjoyed the work and recently restarted her efforts with Helping Harvest.

Val works for Fisher &amp; Paykel, a luxury appliance manufacturer.&nbsp;She enjoys some travel with her job and finds her work with customers to be rewarding.

<strong>What motivated you to start the \#GiveHealthy food collection?</strong>

Alexis: The idea came to us during the SNAP shutdown. We were struggling with the idea that food was starting to feel like a luxury item. There were so many people who relied on benefits they weren’t getting, and we wanted to help. We chose the \#GiveHealthy site because it’s easy to navigate and they’ll deliver the food directly to Helping Harvest, a local organization that does great work but right now needs some extra support.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

Both women were laid off from jobs earlier this year as part of larger downsizing efforts, creating a great deal of anxiety and stress. For Val, the experience ultimately led her to better understand her inner strength and resiliency. Alexis turned to volunteering with Helping Harvest as a way to balance her time during the layoff period and found that she thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Alexis: \[Volunteering\] was a wonderful way to not only use my newfound free time but also felt good to be able to give back during a time when there was so much need.

<strong>What is your favorite place to eat in Berks County?</strong>

Alexis: Taqueria Comālli in West Reading. They make the best guacamole.

Val: Giuliana’s in Spring Township.

<strong>Where in Berks would you take a visitor?</strong>

Val treasures the grounds of the Reading Museum, citing the property’s trails, mature trees, stream, and historic buildings.

Alexis would escort a visitor (accompanied by her dog, Murphy) on a tour of West Reading to experience the parkland and excellent restaurants.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you?</strong>

Val cited her mother, Lynn, saying, “She shows me every day what it means to take care of family and the people around you.”

Alexis cited her family, saying, “They have always loved and supported me, and they’ve made me who I am today.”
