READING — Rabies cases in Berks County have nearly doubled over the past three years, yet residents exposed to the virus may struggle to find answers to basic questions: Which agency handles rabid feral cats? Who shows up when an animal attacks? How can I confirm if the animal that bit me is positive for rabies?

The Pennsylvania Game Commission will <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/about-us/contact-information">assist</a> when a wild animal is involved. The system for pets and feral cats is not as straightforward, which is why we compiled this guide.

<strong>To trap a feral cat suspected of rabies:</strong>

- <a href="https://berksarl.org/animal-control-service-areas/">The Animal Rescue League of Berks</a> provides full animal control services free of charge in six municipalities: Bern Township, City of Reading, Jefferson Township, New Morgan Borough, Upper Bern Township, and Wyomissing Borough.

- Private companies, including <a href="https://www.seitzwildlife.com/">Seitz Wildlife</a> or <a href="https://www.humanewildliferemovalpros.com/">Humane Wildlife Removal</a>, provide animal control services at a fee.

- Groups that work to spay and neuter feral cats — including <a href="https://berkscommunitycats.org/">Berks Community Cats</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Berks-Cats-in-Crisis-61555294649329/">Berks Cats in Crisis</a>, <a href="https://www.nnnlv.org/">No Nonsense Neutering</a>, <a href="https://www.nobodyscats.org/">The Nobody’s Cats Foundation</a>, <a href="https://fairchildcat.org/clinics/other-resources/">Fairchild “Feral Friends” Foundation</a>, and<a href="https://helpinghandsforanimals.org/"> Helping Hands for Animals</a> — can help locate resources to humanely trap and test possibly infected cats. You can also borrow traps from <a href="https://humanepa.org/">Humane Pennsylvania</a>.

<strong>To test a domestic animal showing signs of rabies:</strong>

- The state <a href="http://padls.agriculture.pa.gov/innerpages/PVL_Lab.html">Department of Agriculture’s lab in Harrisburg</a> accepts animal carcasses, prepares samples, and tests for rabies free of charge. The specimen must be sealed and properly refrigerated. The lab is open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

- The state Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services, through its main line at 717-772-2852, can direct people to a veterinarian on-call who can provide information. <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pda/contact-us/regional-offices">Regional offices can</a> also have staff available during work hours who can answer questions. The department also publishes an informational <a href="https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/health/documents/topics/documents/programs/rabies/Rabies%20Virus%202025.pdf">brochure</a>.

- For people who live outside its coverage area, ARL can euthanize an animal under 20 pounds for $100 and $150 for animals larger than that. It will do specimen prep and testing for $250. However, the decision whether to accept the animal is at their discretion, depending on staff availability.

- If the animal is alive and in a trap, experts say the best option is to go to your nearest veterinary clinic, where a medical professional can prepare and submit a specimen for testing. Prices for services vary according to each clinic.

- 24-hour animal clinics include <a href="https://bluepearlvet.com/hospital/wyomissing-pa/?utm_source=maps&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=gbp">BluePearl Pet Hospital</a> in Wyomissing, <a href="https://www.epvmc.com/">Eastern PA Veterinary Medical Center</a> in Allentown, and <a href="https://www.vcvrec.com/">Valley Central Veterinary Referral and Emergency Center</a> in Whitehall Township.

<strong>If you or someone else has been bitten or scratched by an animal suspected of rabies:</strong>

- Wash the wound with soap and water. Seek medical help immediately, and contact the Department of Health at 1-877-PA-HEALTH.
