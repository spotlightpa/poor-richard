José Joel Delgado-Rivera is Spotlight PA’s new general manager for the Berks Bureau. This is a newly created position, supported by the American Journalism Project, responsible for fundraising, partnerships, and community outreach for Spotlight PA’s newsroom in Berks County.

Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Delgado-Rivera previously worked in communications at the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón and at the Puerto Rico Children’s Museum. In his free time, Delgado-Rivera is a magician and performer, sharing his love of magic with younger generations of magicians. He also enjoys volunteering for community causes, exploring Berks, and spending time with his two cats.

“I am honored to join Spotlight PA and help strengthen its mission of delivering independent, high-quality investigative journalism in Berks County,” Delgado-Rivera said. “Local reporting can only exist with strong community support, and I look forward to building new relationships and inspiring the community to support Spotlight PA’s mission ensuring our reporting serves Berks for the long term.”
