This week’s Community Spotlight honoree is Lauren Conrad, 41, who leads <a href="https://cthelightfoundation.org/">C the Light Foundation</a>, which honors her late husband, Kyle, through service to young people and their families.

This conversation, which took place through email, has been edited for length and clarity.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Conrad: Cumru Township

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I live with my sons, Logan, 12, and Carson, 9, and our dog Nya. My husband, Kyle, passed away in September 2022 at age 39 after a long battle with esophageal cancer. Fortunately, we have a wonderfully loving extended family living nearby who have been extremely supportive of us since Kyle’s passing.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what you like about it.</strong>

I started the C the Light Foundation a few months after Kyle died because I wanted a tangible way to keep his memory alive for all who love and miss him dearly, as well as continue his passion for positively impacting youth in our community, as he did as a high school basketball coach and youth group leader at our church. His work here is not done. We are continuing in partnership; I feel his presence and guidance all the time. C the Light is making a positive impact and is something we are doing together.

<strong>Tell us a little bit about C the Light Foundation.</strong>

Since its formation, C the Light has provided funding to Governor Mifflin High School for a new AV studio and equipment, after-school programs, chairs for the new eSports lab, and has sponsored youth sports leagues and teams.

Last November, we built the “C-Shed” on Governor Mifflin’s campus. That is a sports equipment exchange meant to help connect second-hand sporting goods with families throughout the community. The three pillars of our foundation are coaching, connections and community, and the C Shed represents each of those.

We plan to bring in motivational speakers to the middle and high schools each year and are continuing to communicate with district administration as needs arise. As Kyle and I were both GM grads and this community means the world to us, it’s special to be able to contribute in this way. I’m grateful to have been able to create purpose from my pain and find a way to help others while keeping Kyle’s memory alive.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

Losing my husband to cancer at age 39 was by far the greatest challenge I’ve ever faced, and something I wouldn’t wish on anyone. The pain of watching the person I loved most slowly fade from this earth was beyond devastating. Then, having my two young children to raise on my own while navigating my grief and theirs, as well as all the ways life changed so drastically. I’ve had to adjust to this “new normal” and really rediscover who I was on my own. It’s been extremely challenging, but I’ve been doing it. As painful as these last several years have been, I have experienced incredible growth and transformation.

<strong>What is your favorite place to eat in Berks County?</strong>

Mom Chaffe’s Cellarette in West Reading is by far my favorite Berks County restaurant.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to in Berks?</strong>

I recently went to Hawk Mountain for the first time in years and remembered how much I love it there. I feel such a sense of peace being out in nature.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you, and how did they influence you?</strong>

My kids are by far my greatest influence and inspiration. As much as I tend to their needs and work hard to protect, provide for, and guide them, they take care of me just as much. We just give each other unconditional love, and it is truly the greatest honor of my life to be their mom.
