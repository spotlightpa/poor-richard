This conversation has been edited for length and style.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Nancy C. Boyer: Muhlenberg Township.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I live with my awesome husband and my amazing daughter.

<strong>Tell us about your work and what you like about it.</strong>

I have been an elementary teacher for the past 32 years. Twenty-six of those years have been teaching fifth&nbsp;grade in the Wyomissing Area School District.

In 2020, in honor of my daughter, I founded <a href="https://www.nextstepberks.org">Next Step Berks</a>, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, to unite families of individuals with intellectual disabilities/autism who are looking for their loved one to have the ability to live as independently as possible in their own home. The idea of inclusive developments is<a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/new-initiative-bucks-county-inclusive-marketplace-housing-intellectual-developmental-disabilities"> new in Pennsylvania</a> but has been building momentum nationally. After touring multiple sites and speaking to individuals and their families, the idea for Next Step Berks was born.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

The biggest challenge has been pulling together the resources to help people expand on what they believe is possible for individuals with intellectual disabilities/autism.&nbsp;This is paramount to getting this project off the ground.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County.</strong>

Austin’s. It’s a cozy atmosphere with great food and great service. It’s our favorite date night spot.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to in Berks?</strong>

Nolde Forest. It’s the perfect place to lose yourself in nature.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

The <a href="https://www.westreadingborough.com/about-us/mural-walk/">murals of West Reading.</a> Many of them were painted by my former students, which makes them extra special to me. I can get lost in the alleys and avenues of West Reading, taking them all in. They add to the special community feel there.

<strong>Who has had the greatest influence in your life?</strong>

My daughter, Vanessa. I’ve watched her work incredibly hard to learn to speak and communicate, and try to figure out the world around her by navigating social norms that do not make sense to her or come naturally. Her tenacity and endurance inspire me every day. She reminds me that just because we can’t do something<em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>yet</em></strong>&nbsp;doesn’t mean we’ll never be able to do it. It just means we can’t do it&nbsp;<strong><em>yet.</em></strong> She inspires me to remember that we can all do hard things.
