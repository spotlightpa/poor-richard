This week&#39;s Community Spotlight honoree is Garrett Hyneman, an 18-year-old environment advocate and Eagle Scout.

This conversation, which took place over email, has been edited for length and clarity.

<strong>Good Day, Berks:</strong> Where do you live?

<strong>Hyneman: </strong>Shillington.

<strong>Tell us about your family.</strong>

Both of my parents are teachers and I have one 15-year-old sister, Edith. .

<strong>Tell us about your volunteer work and what you like about it:</strong>

Ever since I was a child, I’ve been deeply passionate about protecting our environment. That’s why I recently became the first youth member of What’SUP Berks, a newly created board with the goal of banning single-use plastics in Berks County.

My youth board and I are making an impact in the Governor Mifflin School District by transitioning our cafeterias from plastic to metal utensils, which will save us about $30,000 a year. Outside of school, I am preparing my team to present to all boroughs, townships, and municipalities in Berks County.

The most significant action is occurring at the legislative level, where my peers and I recently drafted a bill for a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags. After a presentation of our bill at the state Capitol, our state representatives and senators are working with my team to revise the bill for our introduction of the bill to the House and the Senate. I’m thrilled that state Senator Judy Schwank has agreed to sponsor our bill, and I look forward to gathering further co-sponsors.

Apart from my governmental efforts, my leadership has grown most significantly because of my experiences with scouting.

For my Eagle Scout project, I spoke to 80 homeowners, coordinated with borough officials to secure funds and iron out logistics, then led 20 volunteers in planting two dozen 10-foot-tall shade trees on a local street. This experience proved my ability to envision a project and gather others, showcasing my core leadership skills.

My Eagle Scout project culminated in my founding of the Mifflin Memorial Arboretum, an expanding tree-planting initiative within my school district. I worked with the borough manager, head arborist, and the district’s head of grounds and operations to plan the planting of 23 trees for the arboretum’s inaugural phase. I’m very excited from the completion of Phase 2 this past spring, which included mentoring of 100 fourth-grade students by high school volunteers … culminating in the planting of more than 20 native shade trees at my primary school campus.

I am a board member of the Youth Advisory Board of the Berks County Community Foundation through the Youth Volunteer Corps. I work with like-minded student leaders to distribute $15,000 in grant money toward critical local issues. Last year, the Youth Advisory Board tackled food insecurity, and I’m very excited to be wrapping up this year’s focus on the environment.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

I faced a challenge with my collegiate research at Alvernia University. While developing a more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly thermoelectric generator … difficulties with shipping of materials created a setback. I had to think outside of the box and innovate in order to make substitutions for chemicals that I was unable to acquire.

<strong>Favorite place to eat in Berks County and why.</strong>

My favorite place to eat is the Peanut Bar in Reading because they have some of the best wings around. The atmosphere is unique and homey and it feels like you go back in time when you enter.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to Berks and why.</strong>

I would take a visitor to Nolde Forest because it … has quite a variety of nature to offer. Some of my best memories of Nolde Forest are early-morning distance runs with my cross-country team. Nolde Forest has beautiful trails that wind through the woods, passing a historic stone mansion, \[Painted\] Turtle Pond, and the iconic Watershed Trail.

<strong>What book, poem, song or art work is meaningful to you?</strong>

My favorite artwork is by Andy Goldsworthy because of his ability to strike harmony with nature. He is able to create beautiful, sustainable art in nature with natural resources like leaves, icicles, pebbles, sticks, etc.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you and how have they influenced you?</strong>

My internship coordinator, mentor, and friend, Kristi Bonanno, has been my greatest influence. She is the person I look up to most … She has taught me the importance of soft skills and how to network effectively. Being well-rounded, knowledgeable, and not being afraid to ask for help leads to phenomenal things.

Ms. Bonanno has provided me support in applying for grants that have led to my enrollment with Alvernia University&#39;s Total Experience Learning program, where I am carrying out green energy research

Ms. Bonanno has truly prepared me for my future.
