<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

<strong>Ashley Shannon Price: </strong>Reading.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.&nbsp;</strong>

I currently live with my long-term domestic partner, Damon Edwards. We’ve been together for over 30 years. Family means a great deal to me. I come from a large, close-knit family with three brothers and one sister, as well as many nieces and nephews who bring a lot of joy and energy into our lives. Although my mother is deceased, I remain very close to my stepfather, who has been a strong and supportive presence in our family. Our family gatherings are always filled with laughter, good food, and a strong sense of love and connection.

<strong>Tell us about your work</strong> <strong>and what you like about it.</strong>

I have proudly worked for the YMCA of Reading and Berks County for 33 years and currently serve as the childcare director at the Reading YMCA. Every day, I am reminded of why I love what I do. Working for the YMCA isn’t just a job; it’s truly a calling. The Y represents community, family, and purpose, and I take great pride in being part of an organization that supports children and families in such meaningful ways.

I absolutely adore the families we serve and am deeply grateful for the trust they place in our program. Watching children grow, learn, and succeed, knowing our team had a part in that, is incredibly rewarding. I also can’t say enough about my dedicated staff, who share the same passion and commitment to excellence. We work together like a family, supporting each other and creating a positive environment for everyone who walks through our doors.

The YMCA has truly become my second home, and I could not imagine working anywhere else. It’s a place that allows me to make a difference every day and gives me the opportunity to build lifelong connections with the community I care so deeply about.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

A major challenge I’ve faced in life is being diagnosed with stage 3 glaucoma and uveitis at the age of 48. At first, I struggled to understand why this was happening to me and felt discouraged. But with the love and support of my family, friends, and my YMCA family, I found strength and purpose again. I now truly believe that God gave me this challenge not to weaken me, but to inspire others to show that with prayer, faith, belief, and love, anything is possible. This journey has taught me resilience, gratitude, and a deeper compassion for others. I’m proud to say I’m fighting to be a living testimony that no obstacle is too great when your heart and faith are strong.

<strong>What is your favorite place to eat in Berks County?</strong>

My favorite place to eat is LongHorn Steakhouse. I absolutely love a good, cooked steak, and LongHorn never disappoints! The food is always great, the service is friendly, and it’s the perfect place to relax, enjoy a great meal, and unwind after a hectic week.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to in Berks?</strong>

If I were taking a visitor around Berks County, I would start by bringing them to the Pagoda. It’s one of our most meaningful landmarks and offers a beautiful view of Reading.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

One of my favorite poems, the one that is meaningful to me, is “<a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/14327858-Don-t-Quit-by-Edgar-Albert-Guest">Don’t Quit,</a>” which is attributed to Edgar A. Guest. It speaks directly to the strength and perseverance that have guided me throughout my life and career. The poem reminds me that challenges are part of every journey, but true success comes from pushing forward even when things feel impossible. The lines, “Rest if you must, but don’t you quit,” resonate deeply with me because it honors the reality that it’s OK to pause and catch your breath as long as you never give up on your purpose. I believe in working hard, staying kind, and trusting that every struggle is shaping something greater.

This poem is my personal motto: No matter how tough the road gets, keep moving forward with faith, heart, and determination.

<strong>Who has had a great influence on you in your life?</strong>

My mother has been the greatest influence in my life. She was incredibly sweet, kind, and hardworking — someone everyone naturally loved. She gave unconditional love to everyone around her and never judged anyone. My mother had a gift for listening and a heart for giving; she would offer her very last just to make sure someone else had what they needed.

Her philosophy was simple yet powerful: “Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen.” I carry that belief with me every day, and it continues to guide me in how I live, lead, and care for others.
