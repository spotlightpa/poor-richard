This conversation, which took place over email, has been edited for length, clarity, and style.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: </strong>Where do you live?

Gena Pina-Garcia: Reading.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I’m blessed with a wonderful husband, Daniel, and I’m a proud mother of five amazing children, and I have 14 incredible grandchildren. Our family also includes a beloved dog and a turtle who keep things lively! I come from a big, loving family myself, with five brothers and a sister.

<strong>Tell us about your work (volunteer and/or otherwise) and what you like about it.</strong>

I serve as the executive director of Social Services and Parenting Pathways at the YMCA of Reading &amp; Berks County. In addition, I volunteer with the <a href="https://www.berkspa.gov/departments/juvenile-probation-office/community-youth-aid-panels">Community Youth Aid Panel</a> (CYAP) through the Juvenile Probation Office. My greatest passion lies in inspiring others to live their best lives. I love empowering people to recognize their own strength and potential. Whether I’m working with staff, families, individuals in the community, or youth, my goal is always to uplift, motivate, and walk alongside them as they grow. As a CYAP volunteer, I’m especially inspired by the opportunity to guide young people toward a brighter future and help them believe in what&#39;s possible.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

One of the most meaningful challenges I faced was stepping into a supervisory role after working alongside my peers for several years. I was initially concerned about how the shift would impact our dynamic. However, the transition turned out to be incredibly positive. I’m grateful to lead such a supportive and dedicated team. They welcomed the change with encouragement and professionalism. The experience reaffirmed the power of trust, mutual respect, and strong relationships in the workplace.

<strong>What’s your favorite place to eat in Berks County and why?</strong>

<a href="https://www.austinsrestaurant.com/">Austin’s</a> is one of my favorite spots! I especially enjoy their apple-walnut salad. It’s fresh, flavorful, and always hits the spot. The atmosphere is great too, making it a perfect place to unwind and enjoy a good meal.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to Berks and why?</strong>

I’d take them to the Reading Public Museum or the Stilling Basin \[at Blue Marsh Lake\]. Both places offer a peaceful escape from the day-to-day. The museum has beautiful walking paths, gardens, and sculptures that make for a relaxing and inspiring stroll. The Stilling Basin is a great spot to be near the water, enjoy a quiet picnic, and spend quality time in nature.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

The poem &#34;<a href="https://www.poeticexpressions.co.uk/poems/why-women-cry/">Why Women Cry</a>” holds deep meaning for me. It speaks to the strength, resilience, and emotional depth of women — the silent battles they fight and the power behind their tears. This poem reminds me of the generations of strong women I have encountered throughout my life, as well as those in my own family. Their grace, love, endurance, and quiet courage have shaped who I am today. It validates the emotional labor women often take on while also honoring their spirit and inner strength. Every time I read it, I feel seen, empowered, and reminded of the sacred beauty in being a woman.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you, and how have they influenced you?</strong>

My mother, Philomena, and my mentor, Sharon, have both had a profound impact on my life. My mother was my first teacher, my constant encourager. She instilled in me the importance of faith, resilience, and compassion. She taught me that I could achieve anything if I tried, and that, if I failed, I should get back up and try again. She always reminded me to treat others the way I want to be treated and, most importantly, to never give up on myself.

Sharon entered my life at a pivotal moment. As a mentor, she saw something in me that I didn’t yet see in myself. She challenged me to believe in my abilities and helped me find my voice. Her unwavering support and belief lit a fire in me to step into my purpose with confidence. Together, their influence has not only shaped my values but has guided me into becoming the woman and professional I am proud to be today.
