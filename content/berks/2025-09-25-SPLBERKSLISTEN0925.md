Spotlight PA launched a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks">Berks community newsroom</a> in spring 2025 to produce in-depth investigative and public-service reporting on all levels of government in Berks County as well as urgent issues related to the spending of taxpayer dollars, jobs, the economy, quality of life, and more.

As part of this effort, we will be hosting a bilingual listening session on Tuesday, Sept. 30 from 5 to 7 p.m. at the GoggleWorks Gardens at Lauer’s Park.

Residents will have the opportunity to speak individually with a reporter and share the topics and issues that directly impact their community. Do you have a specific topic that you want to read more about? A local story idea or tip? Want to share your perspective on local news coverage? We’ll be there to listen!

This is a FREE event. Habrá asistencia disponible en español.

Drop by anytime between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 30 to chat with our team.
