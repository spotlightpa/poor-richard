This week&#39;s Community Spotlight honoree is Lilyanne Ruth DeLoretta, a 17-year-old focused on community service locally and internationally.

This conversation, which took place over email, has been edited for length, clarity, and style.

<strong>Good Day, Berks: Where do you live?</strong>

Lillyanne Ruth DeLoretta: Cumru Township.

<strong>Tell us a little about your family.</strong>

I live with my mother, father, and sister. My mother works at Hubric Resources as a human resources consultant, and my father works at Tower Health Reading Hospital as the outreach laboratory supervisor. My sister is a senior at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Growing up, we would spend our time outdoors. We enjoy hiking, tent camping, and fishing.

<strong>Tell us about your work (volunteer and/or otherwise) and what you like about it.</strong>

Through Immanuel United Church of Christ, I participated in fundraisers for New Journey Community Outreach, Opportunity House, Safe Berks, and Mary’s Shelter. These local initiatives sparked my interest in helping my community and raising awareness for marginalized groups. I’ve attended mission trips to Charleston, West Virginia, and Boone, North Carolina, where we painted homes and built decks and ramps to help people access their homes more easily, and served in food pantries. In 2024, I participated in a mission trip to San Pedro Sula, Honduras, through Immanuel UCC’s partnership with Embraced International, which empowers families to reconnect with their children after being separated. The organization helps to support families and create homes that are safe for children to thrive. Recently, I became very involved in local environmental advocacy work through What’SUP Berks, which advocates for a ban of single-use plastics.

<strong>Tell us about a challenge you faced.</strong>

What’SUP’s goal of ending single-use plastic bags in Pennsylvania has sparked some controversy. A proposed bill has received notable backlash, with commenters across various news platforms expressing concerns about the ban. While we acknowledge these differing viewpoints, the criticism only strengthens our efforts to advocate for this important cause. Many people may not fully realize the environmental, health, and even financial harm that plastic bags can cause — and that’s exactly why our advocacy work matters.

<strong>What’s your favorite place to eat in Berks County and why?</strong>

My favorite place to eat in Berks County is Paolo’s Restaurant &amp; Bar. I enjoy the friendly, comfortable atmosphere. I live near the restaurant, so I have dined at the restaurant with my family and friends for many years. My favorite menu item is the chicken caprese panini with french fries.

<strong>Where would you take a visitor to Berks and why?</strong>

I would begin my tour at Deluxe Diner to eat their delicious chocolate chip pancakes. Then I would take a hike in Nolde Forest. Nolde has beautiful woods and streams to enjoy. It is the perfect place to go to enjoy the local nature of Berks County.

Following our hike, I would take the visitor to the Reading Public Museum. The museum is a great place to admire fine art and sculptures. Concluding our visit to the museum, I would enjoy the lively scene of West Reading. The town has amazing restaurants, boutiques, art galleries, and shops. I would finish the tour at Sweet Ride to eat a scoop of banana peanut butter chocolate chip ice cream.

<strong>What book, poem, song, or artwork is meaningful to you?</strong>

My favorite book is <em>Little Women</em> by Louisa May Alcott, a novel that includes inspiring moral stories. This book has taught me many valuable life lessons. This book proves that all women are heroes of their own story, and are bold, persistent, and strong.

<strong>Who in your life has had a great influence on you, and how have they influenced you?</strong>

My grandparents. They have inspired me beyond belief. Gloria Hutzell, “Grammie,” has taught me strength, resilience, and the importance of higher education. Danny Hutzell, “Poppy,” taught me to love, respect, and preserve nature.
