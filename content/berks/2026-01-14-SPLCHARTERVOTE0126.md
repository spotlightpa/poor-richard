<strong>Update, Jan. 23: </strong>City of Reading voters will decide this year on the future of a city public health department following a vote from the Charter Review Commission.

The commission moved the ballot proposal forward after much debate. If voters approve, the proposal will require the city to establish a Department of Public Health in the following two years. The commission also approved ballot questions that could increase the term of the city clerk to five years and disallow the clerk from serving in political party leadership; and disallow any City Council member from acting as a voting member of a city board, authority, or commission.

The commission surveyed an unknown number of residents over the past five months to collect ideas for ballot amendments, but it has not yet submitted the survey results to the selected Alvernia University professor for analysis. Chair Evelyn Morrison said she planned to meet with the professor this week.

The commission has until Feb. 17 to submit any remaining ballot proposals for the May ballot. The commission can also vote to hold some ballot questions for the general election, and it has discussed deferring the question of the health department until November.

<strong>Update, Jan. 16:</strong> The Reading Charter Review Commission decided to move a small number of its ballot amendment proposals forward. The vote on the most significant idea proposed so far for a city-run health department was postponed.

The commission voted to move five proposals to the May ballot. The commission will continue to meet on Thursdays at City Hall through the end of February to vote on other proposals and accept community ideas.

The ballot amendments confirmed for voters to consider in May are the following:

- Individuals should not be disqualified from appointments to an authority, board or commission because of taxes, fines or other amounts owed to the city, provided that at the time of such appointment, evidence exists of satisfactory arrangements for payment of such amounts.

- To merge the Board of Ethics and Charter Board into one body called the Ethics and Charter Board.

- To codify that the Mayor of Reading will appoint one chief of police.

- To allow that the boundaries of City Council districts will be realigned every 10 years based on the US Census as to provide for proportionate representation.

- To include the following in the Preamble of the Home Rule City Charter: “To ensure equitable and inclusive access to all residents without regard to gender, race, ethnicity, language, sexual preference, religion, or immigration status to the city’s governmental programming and services.”

<strong>Original story</strong>

READING — Reading residents have the rare chance to weigh in this week about possible major changes to local government, including the establishment of a public health department and removal of barriers to volunteer for board positions.

The <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/08/reading-pennsylvania-charter-review-commission-delay-government-reform-local-government/">Charter Review Commission</a> is scheduled to vote on multiple proposals to change the city’s main governing document on Thursday. If the votes carry, the changes to the charter (which acts as the municipality’s version of the Constitution) would not be guaranteed. Instead, voters will make the final determination in the May primary election.

<a href="https://www.readingpa.gov/charter-review-commission">The commission</a> is the only unelected body with the authority to craft ballot amendments without going through a petition process. It has until the end of February to consider ideas. Through the commission’s work, <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/readingpa/latest/reading_pa/0-0-0-728">voters previously</a> approved local term limits and eliminated residency requirements for high-ranking employees.

City officials initially failed to convene the commission amid confusion about the mandated timeline and who was responsible for bringing the group together, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/08/reading-pennsylvania-charter-review-commission-delay-government-reform-local-government/">Spotlight PA previously reported</a>. The city must organize the commission every three to five years for a six-month period, and failure to do so leaves what gets on the ballot to the discretion of elected officials.

Some proposed questions aim to settle or clarify internal City Hall matters, while others could have a direct impact on resident services. The current proposals would ask voters if they support the following:

- The creation of a Department of Public Health with the authority to collaborate with community partners. It would be fully operational within two years of voter approval.

- To allow individuals with outstanding parking tickets of $300 or less to be appointed to city boards, commissions, or authorities.

- To merge the Board of Ethics and Charter Board into one body.

- To disallow a member of City Council from serving as a board member of any municipal authority.

- To add &#34;mayor shall appoint one chief of police,&#34; which would codify the current practice that the commission believes is not clear in the charter.

- To increase the city clerk’s term from two years to five years.

- To disallow any member of an authority, board, or commission from serving more than three terms consecutively.

- To disallow any active city employee from being appointed or serving on an authority, board, or commission.

- To allow appointees to serve concurrently on more than one authority, board, or commission.

- To realign the boundaries of City Council districts every 10 years based on the most recent U.S. census.

The commission is expected to debate changes to these proposals on Thursday before its vote. It may also discuss ideas to require an annual forensic audit of city finances, expand the charter’s preamble to more closely resemble the recently passed <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/10/reading-welcoming-city-ordinance-immigrant-protection-local-government/">welcoming ordinance</a>, and address environmental concerns.

The most significant of the proposals so far — namely, the public health department and the various changes to boards and commissions — come after much discussion in other city and county organizations.

The city has an existing <a href="https://www.readingpa.gov/board-of-health">Board of Health</a>, but the charter commission’s idea varies in scope: The health department would help coordinate services among county nonprofits. Berks County commissioners <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/02/public-health-study-berks-county/">paused similar efforts early last year</a> due to impending budget concerns.

The charter commission’s confirmed ballot questions do not need the approval of the mayor’s office or City Council — and neither have weighed in on the possibilities at commission meetings. Jack Gombach, the city’s managing director, told Spotlight PA he needed more information on how a city health department would function and its goals, especially in light of growing <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/11/reading-budget-reserves-local-government/">projected budget deficits</a> over the next few years. He also questioned whether the charter was the most appropriate avenue for establishing a new department.

“I think like all communities, we’re struggling post-COVID of how do we address public health from a policy perspective,” Gombach said. “The other side to that is that this very realistically will increase costs for the city, both from a legacy cost and head count, to also programming.”

Meanwhile, Reading councilors and administration officials have lamented <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/08/reading-board-vacancies-local-government/">the struggle to attract volunteers</a> for the <a href="https://www.readingpa.gov/vacancies">various boards and commissions</a>. Many have lacked a voting quorum for months at a time, halting their duties. The commission proposals aim to give more options for recruiting residents, while also removing City Council members from the boards. This could include expanding eligibility for people with outstanding parking tickets, as well as water, electric, or other bills.

Members of the public can comment on the questions and offer new ideas during the meeting at 5:30 p.m. in City Council chambers at City Hall. Residents can also <a href="https://www.readingpa.gov/charter-review-commission">contact the members</a> of the commission to complete a survey of what they feel is important for the city to address.
