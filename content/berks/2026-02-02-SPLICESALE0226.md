UPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.

The warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the United States government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26777680-14875047-274862804-docimage-actual/">deed records show</a>. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.

Spotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. The building is one of at least 23 that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/us-spends-hundreds-of-millions-on-warehouses-for-ice-detention-centers">ICE plans to convert</a> into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.

The previous owner, PCCP LLC, purchased the warehouse in 2024 from GASCD Industrial Development LLC for $57.5 million, deed records show. PCCP LLC is a national commercial real estate equity firm.
