Beginning in January 2026, Spotlight PA will host the Community Forums—originally created by the Berks Alliance in 2019 and now supported by Berks County Community Foundation—as we expand our local programming for the Berks County community.

Berks County residents in Spotlight PA’s <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks-report">research project</a> in 2023-4 said the community lacked information about arts and culture, local sports, human interest stories, positive storytelling, events, employment issues, among other topics. Although not the original focus of the newsroom, Spotlight PA recognizes the importance of creating a space to address these topics.

“Part of Spotlight PA’s goal in Berks County is to be a catalyst for discussion and action on the most pressing issues facing the community, and these forums are a natural fit,” said Christopher Baxter, CEO &amp; President of Spotlight PA. “We look forward to hosting the county&#39;s best and brightest each month.”

The addition of the forums will not only allow Spotlight PA Berks to bring a broader array of topics to the community outside of the regular investigative reporting, but will also expand the reach of the conversations to a statewide audience.

The monthly forums will continue to be coordinated by Dave Myers, Berks County Community Foundation senior fellow, and will feature initiatives and organizations that have an impact in Berks.

“I am looking forward to partnering with Spotlight PA Berks Bureau to continue and hopefully expand these conversations,” said Myers. “It is an opportunity to not only continue these important discussions, but expand their reach.”
