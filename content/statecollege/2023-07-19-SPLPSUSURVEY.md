Spotlight PA wants to better understand how Penn State handles reports of misconduct, no matter how small they may seem. We hope to gather information about whether university representatives respond to misconduct, how the different compliance systems function, and whether people who speak up face any form of retaliation.

As part of our <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2023/07/penn-state-sandusky-accountability-transparency-misconduct-retaliation/">“Missed Conduct”</a> investigation, we found repeated and documented failures in Penn State’s internal accountability system, including multiple allegations of misconduct regarding the university’s former top ethics officer.

We want to hear from Penn State students and employees about what happened — whether you reported misconduct or if you were the subject of a report. We also want to know if you witnessed or experienced some form of misconduct or harassment and decided not to disclose it. Your direct experiences help us ask the right questions as we continue our coverage.

If you’d like to share your story, use the form below and Spotlight PA Penn State Reporter Wyatt Massey may follow up with you. None of the information you share, including your name, will be published without your explicit consent.

Documents related to your experience — emails, copies of official complaints, text messages, DMs, screenshots, etc. — will help us better understand what happened. You can attach such documents below. Otherwise, we’ve set up <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/tips">several secure ways to share information with us</a>.

If you’d like to speak with Massey directly, you can contact him on Signal, an encrypted phone messaging app, or call 445-236-0562.
