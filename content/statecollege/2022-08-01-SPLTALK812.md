To further our commitment to using public service journalism to connect and inform communities across Pennsylvania, this summer Spotlight PA launched a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/" target="_blank">regional bureau in State College</a>.

Our team of four covers north-central Pennsylvania, focusing on local government accountability, issues that affect rural communities, and Penn State, one of the state’s largest and most influential institutions.

The bureau already has published a range of stories, from a report on <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2022/07/centre-county-transparency-public-records/" target="_blank">salary data in Centre County</a> to an investigation of <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2022/06/pfas-chemicals-drinking-water-benner-township-contamination/" target="_blank">water contamination in Benner Township</a>. We also have launched a weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/talkofthetown/#archives" target="_blank">Talk of the Town</a>, that rounds up our coverage, highlights other local reporting, and showcases north-central Pennsylvania’s many communities.

We spent more than a year building the bureau, and part of that work included attending community events, meeting with officials and community members, and coordinating with other newsrooms in the region.

This event was a continuation of those conversations. Watch below to meet the staff of our new bureau, get a behind-the-scenes look at our coverage, and learn how to contact us with feedback or story tips.

Our panelists were:

- <b>Sarah Rafacz</b>, State College editor

- <b>Ashad Hajela</b>, rural affairs reporter

- <b>Wyatt Massey</b>, Penn State investigative reporter

- <b>Min Xian</b>, local accountability reporter
