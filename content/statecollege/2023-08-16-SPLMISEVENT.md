In the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, Penn State vowed to never again let such extreme misconduct happen under its watch. The school created a series of offices and positions specifically to ensure it upheld safe practices that protected staff, students, and faculty.

Over a decade later, a Spotlight PA and Centre Daily Times review of that monitoring system revealed it began to unravel shortly after it was created. The <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2023/07/penn-state-sandusky-accountability-transparency-misconduct-retaliation/">newsrooms’ year-long investigation found</a>, among other issues, that Penn State lacks a unified way to track all reported misconduct, and that staff and students fear retaliation if they speak up.

To further examine the issue, Spotlight PA hosted a panel on how the newsrooms reported the story and what the investigation uncovered. Watch it below.

<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>

- <strong>Wyatt Massey</strong>, investigative reporter, Spotlight PA State College

- <strong>Barry Dyller</strong>, lawyer specializing in Title IX and civil rights

- <strong>Eugene DePasquale</strong>, former Pennsylvania auditor general
