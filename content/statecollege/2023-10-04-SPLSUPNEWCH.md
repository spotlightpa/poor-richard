HARRISBURG — An embattled City of DuBois official was slapped with additional charges Wednesday in a sweeping political corruption case alleging he stole hundreds of thousands of public and nonprofit dollars.

Suspended City Manager Herm Suplizio now faces a total of 23 criminal counts — including 13 felonies — filed by prosecutors with the state Office of Attorney General. He was arraigned Wednesday in Clearfield County on $100,000 unsecured bail.

The charges Wednesday replace the 15 counts of theft and other crimes that prosecutors filed against Suplizio, 63, earlier this year. Some of the counts tweak the amounts of money Suplizio had already been charged with allegedly stealing from DuBois — a small city about two hours northeast of Pittsburgh — as well as from a nonprofit and other community organization that he ran.

Many of the new charges relate to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2023/05/pa-dubois-herm-suplizio-toni-cherry-cash-city-hall/">a bag containing nearly $94,000 in cash</a> that was delivered to City Hall in early May.

At the time, city officials said only that the money had been dropped off in a gift bag by the city’s solicitor, Toni Cherry. Cherry did not say where or how she got it — only that it belonged to a fund associated with the city’s annual summer celebration, called Community Days. Suplizio had a key role in organizing the festival and managed bank accounts associated with the event.

The money, it was later discovered, had been stored at the DuBois Area United Way, where Suplizio separately had served as executive director.

According to the new charges Wednesday, the money was discovered in September of last year by United Way employees; it had been wrapped in a green zippered bag and placed inside a safe inside the building. When one of those employees accessed the safe two months later, the bag was gone.

Then, in March of this year, while cleaning and removing exposed television cables inside the United Way, that same employee discovered three metal lock boxes fastened to the walls above the ceiling tiles in one of the offices in the building, prosecutors claim. Several days later, the employee noticed “ceiling tile debris” on the floor, leading to the discovery of a fourth lock box above the ceiling tiles.

The four keys corresponding to those lock boxes, according to investigators, were found in Suplizio’s United Way desk.

Cherry, according to investigators, told DuBois City Council members during a closed-door meeting in May that Suplizio had brought her the money six weeks earlier, but that she had held onto it “to keep the PA OAG from confiscating it.” When interviewed by the attorney general’s office, however, investigators claim she said she did not remember when Suplizio had brought it to her.

Cherry could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. She does not face any charges.

Separately, Suplizio faces new charges in connection with efforts he allegedly made to shield the former mayor of DuBois from shoplifting charges.
