Our second annual “Clink and Think” Quiz Bash Fundraiser on Sept. 15 was another sold-out affair at Axemann Brewery with $13,500 raised to benefit Spotlight PA’s State College regional bureau! All proceeds will support investigative and public-service journalism in State College and north-central Pennsylvania.

Thank you to Katie O’Toole, event chair, and her committee: R Thomas Berner, John Dillon, John Nichols, Lassie MacDonald, Dana Miller, and Nancy Chiswick.

Steve Jones, legendary announcer of Penn State sports, led the teams with competitive rounds of questions on Pennsylvania-themed trivia. Each of the top four teams received prize packages from Tait Farm Foods, Giant, Wegmans, Rapid Transit Sports, Shade Mountain Winery, Trader Joe’s, Family Clothesline, Parisi Gray Wealth Management, and Axemann Brewery.
