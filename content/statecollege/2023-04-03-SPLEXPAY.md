A Commonwealth Court judge recently revoked the property tax exemption of a nonprofit hospital in Southeastern Pennsylvania because its parent company was operating with a profit motive, as <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/03/pa-nonprofit-hospital-property-tax-exemption-court-ruling/">previously reported by Spotlight PA</a>.

Tower Health charged the hospitals it owned exorbitant management fees, Judge Christine Fizzano Cannon found. The ruling also found executives were being paid “eye-popping” salaries and bonuses were tied to the health system’s financial success.

Former Tower Health CEO Clint Matthews was paid about $2.5 million in salary and bonuses in fiscal year 2020, according to the tax forms that nonprofits are required to submit to the IRS.

In north-central Pennsylvania, most hospitals are part of larger health systems such as University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Geisinger, and Penn Highlands.

In fiscal year 2020, the CEOs of those systems raked in seven-figure incomes. Jeffrey Romoff of UPMC made $9.5 million; Jaewon Ryu of Geisinger made $4.6 million; and Steve Fontaine of Penn Highlands made $1.1 million.

To get a broader picture of executive pay at nonprofit hospitals in north-central Pennsylvania, Spotlight PA compiled a list of salary and bonus totals from facilities in the region.
