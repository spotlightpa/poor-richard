Thanks for being a part of the Spotlight PA State College community. We’re very proud of our free weekly newsletter, Talk of the Town, and want as many Pennsylvanians as possible to get access to the local stories, unique events, and beautiful north-central PA photos that we share.

That’s where you come in. We want to reward loyal readers who share our reporting with friends, family, co-workers, and neighbors.

The reward? Anytime someone you refer subscribes to Talk of the Town, you get one step closer to free Spotlight PA swag.

Easy, right? All you have to do is send **[this link](/friend/) (https://spotlightpa.org/friend/)** to as many people as you want. We’ll keep track of who signs up and send you Spotlight PA swag based on the number of referrals.

- **[Sunglasses](https://shop.spotlightpa.org/products/spotlight-pa-sunglasses): Three referrals**
- **Sunglasses + [T-shirt](https://shop.spotlightpa.org/products/spotlight-pa-t-shirt): Six referrals**
- **Sunglasses + T-shirt + [Pennsylvania Tote Bag](https://shop.spotlightpa.org/products/pennsylvania-tote-bag): Ten referrals**

We’ll run this program through the month of February and will start sending out swag in March 2025.

Thanks for participating!
