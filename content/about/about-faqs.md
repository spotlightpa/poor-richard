**Q: What is Spotlight PA?**

**A:** Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan and statewide newsroom dedicated to producing investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government — with a particular focus on how it's spending your tax dollars — and significant statewide issues that matter to communities in all corners of the state. The project is led by [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com) in partnership with the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/) and [PennLive/The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com).

**Q: What is Spotlight PA’s mission?**

**A:** The [mission of Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/about/) is to hold powerful private and public forces in Pennsylvania — especially governments, businesses and special interests — to account through urgent and compelling investigative journalism that drives change and strengthens our democracy, the state and all who live here.

**Q: Why was Spotlight PA created?**

**A:** Aggressive reporting on Pennsylvania’s state government has withered as newsrooms have faced financial pressure and cut back on coverage. With its team of seven talented reporters, Spotlight PA is the single largest expansion of the statehouse reporting corps in recent history.

**Q: What does Spotlight PA cover?**

**A:** Spotlight PA’s reporters are assigned to cover the state government’s many departments, agencies and commissions, as well as significant local and regional issues that cut across political and geographic boundaries. Their goal is to produce digital-first journalism that drives change.

**Q: Why should I support Spotlight PA?**

**A:** High-quality investigative and accountability journalism takes a lot of time and resources, and it’s critical to holding our elected officials and those in power responsible for their actions. Too often, however, it’s pushed aside because of financial struggles and budgetary constraints. We aim to fill the void in a bold way, but we need your support to keep doing this important work.

And we won't be afraid to experiment.
