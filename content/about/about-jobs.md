## Managing Editor, Berks County bureau

### [Apply here](https://spotlightpa.applytojob.com/apply/KI0Y4rFuyL/Managing-Editor-Berks-County-Bureau)

**Summary**: Spotlight PA is seeking a managing editor to lead its new bureau in Berks County. This will be the second regional bureau established by Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent, nonpartisan newsroom founded in 2019 to revitalize investigative and public-service reporting across Pennsylvania. The first is based in State College and launched in 2022 (spotlightpa.org/statecollege). The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing nonpartisan journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories regularly republished across 100+ partner newsrooms, allowing our vital reporting to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners and drive positive change.

The Berks bureau will produce in-depth investigative and public-service reporting on all levels of government in Berks County as well as urgent issues related to the spending of taxpayer dollars, jobs, the economy, quality of life, and more. The bureau’s journalism will be distributed via Spotlight PA and its partner network, including multiple outlets in the county, filling information gaps and elevating stories from Berks to a statewide audience. Through its journalism, events, local newsletter, and more, the bureau will act as a vital public service in Berks County, while also promoting greater collaboration among media and other organizations.

**What you’ll do**: The managing editor will be our local, on-the-ground expert, and will take the lead in shaping our coverage plans in advance of the bureau’s anticipated launch in April 2025. The editor will supervise three reporters based in the county to execute the newsroom’s goal of creating compelling accountability and public-service journalism that gets results. With support from Spotlight PA’s editorial team, the managing editor will mentor and coach reporters across several beats — city/county government, local government, and social issues. The managing editor will also produce a newsletter focused on Berks County (frequency to be determined) and handle other duties as assigned, including collaborating and working with community partners, as well as appearing at in-person editorial and fundraising events.

**Who we're looking for**: The managing editor should have experience overseeing, editing, and executing local journalism from idea through publication, and, ideally, with impact. Applicants should have strong editing and story organization skills, and be enthusiastic about working one-on-one with reporters in various stages of their careers. We want someone who’s not afraid to bring big ideas to the table with the skills and persistence to pull them off. The ability to work in a collaborative environment with external partners is a must. We’re an agile startup that values camaraderie, and everyone on our team pitches in across the organization and brings a sense of urgency and drive to their work every day. We also value innovation, creativity, and originality, and we’re always seeking to explore new and experimental ways of telling stories and connecting with audiences.

**This job is full-time and includes benefits. The editor must have a strong working knowledge of Reading and/or Berks County. The position is remote, though applicants should be based in or willing to relocate to Berks County. A shared working space may be available for the team. This position is budgeted for a salary of $80,000-$90,000, depending on experience.**

**Applicants should include a resume and a one-page cover letter answering the following questions: 1) What issues are most pressing to Berks County that receive little or no attention?; and 2) Tell us about a difficult project you led to completion, and what impact came as a result?**

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage people from marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds to apply, including people of color, women, people from the LGBTQIA+ community, and people with disabilities.
