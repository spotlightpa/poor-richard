This role is part of our pilot Spotlight PA Studios project, which aims to expand our partnership network to broadcast television and reach new and underserved Pennsylvania audiences.

This person will work closely with Spotlight PA’s Deputy Editor as well as a point of contact with our television partners to ensure proper support on visual/technical issues.

You should be a self-starter and have strong organizational and communication skills. You must also be committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team and through your work.

**This is a six-month contract position, with a budgeted flat rate of $40,000 to $50,000.** Pre-approved travel and related expenses will be reimbursed. Benefits are not included.

**Applicants should include a resume, cover letter, and links to past work that showcase high-quality broadcast segments similar to what we seek to create.**
