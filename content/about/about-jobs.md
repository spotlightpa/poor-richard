**Summary**: We are seeking a Newsroom Developer to join our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide and regional issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across more than 120 partner newsrooms, allowing our journalism to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners. The newsroom is supported by grants and donations from individual and institutional donors who believe in the value of the work and want to sustain it.

This position is part of our Democracy Initiative, which seeks to enhance our growing portfolio of voter-centric election resources, training, events, and general service journalism, and to oversee new and creative ways to connect those resources with communities across the state. A particular focus of the initiative is expanding Spotlight PA’s reach and value among people who do not normally engage with traditional media or who have felt left out or misrepresented by conventional election and government coverage. The purpose of the initiative is to enhance engagement with our democracy, a cornerstone of its preservation, and showcase the direct value Spotlight PA can provide to communities beyond the written word.

In addition to on-site work, this might also include making elements embeddable for partners.
