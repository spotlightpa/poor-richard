## Membership Manager

### **[Apply here](https://us63.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/philainquirer/Posting/View/695)**

**Summary:** We are seeking a Membership Manager to join our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across dozens of partner newsrooms, allowing our vital investigative and public-service reporting to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners. The newsroom is supported by grants and donations from Pennsylvanians who believe in the value of the work and want to sustain it. In partnership with the American Journalism Project, we are building out a best-in-class development team to enable Spotlight PA to sustain and grow its reporting in the long term.

**What you’ll do:** The Membership Manager will lead aggressive growth of Spotlight PA’s grassroots donation program, a critical revenue stream for the newsroom and a key part of its growth plan. This position will report to the Development Director and will also work closely with the Major Gifts Director and the Executive Director to expand Spotlight PA’s fundraising sophistication and capacity.

**Responsibilities will include:**

* Manage Spotlight PA’s broad membership program, which includes running seasonal membership campaigns and end-of-month or flash campaigns as needed, to ensure we’re meeting our monthly goals. This includes the data-informed determination of targets, strategy, and themes for each campaign; writing campaign copy and sending it through Mailchimp; keeping track of our progress on a weekly basis and adjusting as needed; and corresponding directly with members.
* Devise and implement creative strategies to build community among Spotlight PA members (e.g. through member-only newsletters; events; swag or other perks).
* Keep all of our membership materials and marketing fresh and up-to-date.
* Develop and maintain creative and innovative partnerships to drive member growth. We are interested, for example, in partnering with a local food bank or another charitable organization during campaigns to incentivize membership and to give back to the communities we cover.
* Manage all operations related to membership efforts, including gift processing, direct mail, and thank-you letters.
* Respond to member questions in a timely and respectful fashion, and keep the “supporters” page on our website up-to-date.
* Advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives on our team and through your external membership work.
* Collaborate with the Major Gifts Director and Development Director to identify individuals with the potential to give mid-level or major gifts.
* Help the team with other fundraising tasks as necessary.

**Who we’re looking for:** The membership director should be very detail-oriented, with strong organizational and communication skills, and passionate about revitalizing non-partisan, independent journalism in Pennsylvania. Previous experience with grassroots fundraising, Mailchimp and Salesforce is a major plus. We welcome applications from individuals with experience in grassroots fundraising, membership programs, and email marketing across a wide spectrum of industries, or from within journalism itself (e.g. community engagement or audience development). We also encourage those with these skills who have taken other career paths to apply.

An ability to work in a collaborative environment is a must. We’re an agile startup that values camaraderie, and everyone on our team pitches in across the organization and brings a sense of urgency and drive to their work every day. We also value innovation, creativity, and originality, and we’re always seeking to explore new and experimental ways of connecting with readers and members.

**This job is full-time and includes benefits, and is fully remote, though a home base in Pennsylvania is preferred. This position is budgeted for a salary from $65,000-$75,000, depending on experience. Applicants should include a resume and cover letter explaining why they’re a good fit for this role. Note that the application portal is managed by The Philadelphia Inquirer, but Spotlight PA operates as an independent newsroom.** 

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage people from marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds to apply, including people of color, women, people from the LGBTQIA+ community, and people with disabilities.

## Senior Editor, Investigations

### **[Apply here](https://us63.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/philainquirer/Posting/View/697)**

**Summary:** We are seeking an experienced investigative journalist to join the editing team at Spotlight PA, a nationally award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capital and urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across 90+ partner newsrooms, allowing our journalism to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners.

**What you’ll do:** The Senior Editor will lead Spotlight PA’s highest-level investigative reporting. This editor will mentor and coach reporters across various beats to help them identify potential stories, sharpen their focus, hold them to deadlines, and deliver accountability-focused projects and investigations of a short-, medium-, and long-term nature. The editor should have experience — either as a reporter or editor — executing this kind of investigative journalism from idea through publication, and with impact. A background in using data to power investigations and creative ways of presenting investigative work is a bonus.

**Who we’re looking for:** 

Applicants should have strong organization and communication skills, and be enthusiastic about working one-on-one with a team of reporters in various stages of their careers, as well as with journalists in other newsrooms across the state. 

An ability to work in a collaborative environment and juggle multiple complex projects simultaneously is a must. As an agile startup, Spotlight PA editors play a role in every aspect of a story’s development, from pitch generation to line editing to art assignments and headline writing. Everyone on our team pitches in across the organization and brings a sense of urgency and drive to their work. 

We’re looking for someone who’s not afraid to bring big ideas to the table, and who has the skills and persistence to pull them off. We value innovation, creativity, and originality, and we’re always seeking to explore new and experimental ways of telling stories and connecting with audiences.

This job is full-time and includes benefits. Our newsroom is remote and reporters are based throughout Pennsylvania. For this role, we will consider candidates remotely from anywhere in the U.S. The position is budgeted for a salary of $95,000-$105,000, but is flexible depending on experience. Applicants should include a resume and cover letter explaining the following:

* How they can support and bolster Spotlight PA’s investigative reporting on Day 1;
* How their past experience serves as evidence of their ability, including a demonstrated ability to manage multiple complex projects simultaneously;
* Specific examples of their commitment to diverse sourcing and story selection

**Note that the application portal is managed by The Philadelphia Inquirer, but Spotlight PA operates as an independent newsroom.** 

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage people from marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds to apply, including people of color, women, people from the LGBTQIA+ community, and people with disabilities.
