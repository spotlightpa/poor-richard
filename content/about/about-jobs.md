##  Multimedia Journalist, Democracy Initiative (contract)
### [Apply here](https://spotlightpa.applytojob.com/apply/rnDdccuevI/Multimedia-Journalist-Democracy-Initiative)

**Summary:** We are seeking an experienced Multimedia Journalist to work with our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide and regional issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across more than 120 partner newsrooms, allowing our journalism to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners. The newsroom is supported by grants and donations from individual and institutional donors who believe in the value of the work and want to sustain it.

This contract role is part of our Democracy Initiative, which seeks to enhance our growing portfolio of voter-centric election resources, training, events, and general service journalism, and to oversee new and creative ways to connect those resources with communities across the state. A particular focus of the initiative is expanding Spotlight PA’s reach and value among people who do not normally engage with traditional media or who have felt left out or misrepresented by conventional election and government coverage.

**What you’ll do:** The Multimedia Journalist will work alongside our staff reporters and television partners to produce broadcast-ready news segments to air via our partner network and other Spotlight PA channels. The Multimedia Journalist will primarily work on creating news segments to run in tandem with stories underway by Spotlight PA staff, but it’s possible there could be some original reporting. The Multimedia Journalist will be responsible for scripting, shooting, and editing 1-2 broadcast-ready packages per week. This work may include, but not be limited to, researching and gathering content, writing clear, accurate, and interesting scripts, breaking down complicated and involved stories so they are easily understood, and gathering or creating relevant, impactful, and appropriate images with steady, sequenced video and clean audio. This person will also work with our point of contact at our TV partners to ensure packages are presented in the correct formats, standards, and are as “ready-to-use” as possible.

**We’re looking for candidates with:** With the immediacy of the election and an urgent need for our reporting to reach as many people as possible across Pennsylvania, we’re looking for experienced candidates with a track record of independently producing high-quality broadcast news segments. Adaptability, flexibility, and a sharp attention to detail and accuracy are paramount. This role is part of our pilot Spotlight PA Studios project, which aims to expand our partnership network to broadcast television and reach new and underserved Pennsylvania audiences.

This person will work closely with Spotlight PA’s Deputy Editor as well as a point of contact with our television partners to ensure proper support on visual/technical issues. An ability to work in a collaborative environment is a must, as you will work closely with editors and reporters on staff. Applicants should be goal-oriented and able to work independently. You should be a self-starter and have strong organizational and communication skills. You must also be committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team and through your work.

**This is a six-month contract position, with a budgeted flat rate of $40,000 to $50,000.** Pre-approved travel and related expenses will be reimbursed. Benefits are not included.

**Applicants should include a resume, cover letter, and links to past work that showcase high-quality broadcast segments similar to what we seek to create.**

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to submit an application, including women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ\+ people, and individuals with disabilities.
