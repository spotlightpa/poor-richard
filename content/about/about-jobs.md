## General Manager, Berks County bureau

### [Apply here](https://spotlightpa.applytojob.com/apply/olT77Rl9Tb/General-Manager-Spotlight-PA-Berks-County)

**Summary**: Summary: Spotlight PA is seeking a general manager to lead its local revenue, partnership, and community outreach/engagement initiatives for its new bureau in Berks County. This will be the second regional bureau established by Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent, nonpartisan newsroom founded in 2019 to revitalize investigative and public-service reporting across Pennsylvania. The first is based in State College and launched in 2022 ([spotlightpa.org/statecollege](http://spotlightpa.org/statecollege)). The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing nonpartisan journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories regularly republished across 125+ partner newsrooms, allowing our vital reporting to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners and drive positive change.

The Berks bureau will produce in-depth investigative and public-service reporting on all levels of government in Berks County as well as urgent issues related to the spending of taxpayer dollars, jobs, the economy, quality of life, and more. The bureau’s journalism will be distributed via Spotlight PA and its partner network, including multiple outlets in the county, filling information gaps and elevating stories from Berks to a statewide audience. Through its journalism, events, local newsletter, and more, the bureau will act as a vital public service in Berks County, while also promoting greater collaboration among media and other organizations.

**What you’ll do:** The general manager will be the local business and community engagement lead for Spotlight PA’s Berks bureau. This position will be responsible for engaging in all aspects of community leadership and participation, and will be the face of Spotlight PA in Berks County. The general manager will attend and participate in the most important events and conversations happening within the community, from the local rotary to the chamber of commerce, to nonprofit gatherings. The general manager will be responsible for building and stewarding relationships and strategic partnerships within the community, as well as a corps of local volunteers to expand our presence and reach. The general manager will be the point person on ensuring the bureau’s three-year runway toward sustainability is on track and meeting targets, with a focus on local business revenue, sponsorships of Spotlight PA products, strategic partnerships, and fundraising events in the county. The general manager will also assist statewide fundraising efforts within the local community, and identify new opportunities for Spotlight PA to grow its community presence and sustainability.

**Who we're looking for**: The general manager should be someone who is engaged in civic life in Berks County and has experience with sales and/or fundraising (individual & corporate/business giving, sponsorships, fundraising events), community relations/engagement, and public relationships. The general manager should be a kinetic, community connector who is passionate about revitalizing local journalism and enhancing Spotlight PA’s profile locally. The general manager should have experience working with volunteers for community outreach and engagement (e.g. tabling at community events). The general manager must have a strong working knowledge of Reading and/or Berks County.

This job is full-time and includes benefits. **This is a two-year, grant-funded position.** The position is remote, though applicants should be based in or near Berks County. This position is budgeted for a salary of $80,000-$90,000, depending on experience.

Applicants should include a resume and a one-page cover letter answering the following questions: 1) How would you grow Spotlight PA’s profile and revenue in Berks County?; and 2) Tell us about your previous successes in sales, fundraising, and/or community engagement. 

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage people from marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds to apply, including people of color, women, people from the LGBTQIA+ community, and people with disabilities.
